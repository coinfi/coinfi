The quest to become a leader in Gartner&rsquo;s Magic Quadrant would lead us to become a founding member of the MIT Auto-ID Center, where Kevin Ashton invented the term &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo;. It also lead us to collaborate with the brilliant minds of BiosGroup, a spin-off of the Santa Fe Institute and founded by the godfather of complexity science, Stuart Kauffman. The meeting Albrecht Diener (SVP of GBU Supply Chain Management) and I had with Steve David and his supply chain visionaries including Jake Barr and Franz Dill was a pivotal moment in my professional life.</p>\n<p>Not unlike blockchain technologies today, supply chain optimization was still a nascent field that held great promise, but struggled with technology limitations and organizational roadblocks. At a time when companies still struggled to implement centralized supply chain planning systems in their 4 walls, we no longer viewed supply chains as static, linear chains, but as dynamic, multi-entity networks that would need to become increasingly open and responsive to external data feeds and real-time events, be it from business partners or emerging sensor networks. Our vision was to blur the lines between the physical world and the world of computer systems using sensor technologies and software agents to create what we called &ldquo;Real-World Aware Adaptive Supply Networks&rdquo;. The system we envisioned would need to be inherently event-driven and able to interprete and process the massive amounts of data generated by sensor networks in a decentralized fashion without human intervention. Could distributed intelligence provide an answer to realizing constantly evolving, &ldquo;adaptive&rdquo; supply networks that could make predictions and coordinate local decisions with adjacent nodes? What might we learn from swarm intelligence and self-organizing principles employed by ant colonies, bee hives or flocks of birds? Where existing supply chain optimization systems were centralized and created brittle plans unable to respond to real-world events, we envisioned a distributed network of self-interested parties, based on autonomous multi-agent systems.</p>\n<p>However, we struggled with the question of what the underlying infrastructure of such an inherently distributed computing network might be. How would we manage state across a distributed system? How would we manage identities in what was supposed to be an open network and create trust? Who would carry the cost of hardware in such a shared infrastructure? How could we trust the results of local computations and distributed decisions? How would we manage the life-cycle of distributed, multi-agent systems?</p>\n<p>When I first learned about blockchains and the Ethereum platform back in 2015, I was excited about its potential. At the same time, I understood blockchain architectures&rsquo; inherent scalability limitations and transaction fees as obstacles to real world adoption. I also new that the energy intensive mining and consensus mechanism of traditional blockchains would not be a good fit with low cost IoT devices and intermittent networks.</p>\n<p>When IOTA introduced the first next generation blockchainless approach to distributed ledgers built specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT) and the machine-to-machine (M2M) economy, I was excited about its potential to bring virtually unlimited scalability and fee-less micro-transactions to the world. However, important building blocks such as smart contracts were missing.</p>\n<p><strong>Enter Qubic</strong></p>\n<p>Qubic introduces not only oracles and smart contracts, but quorum-based computations, a form of distributed computing. It essentially makes the IOTA Tangle programmable and leverages the data transfer protocol and peer-to-peer fee-less micro transactions to create incentives for outsourced computations using zero-fee micro-transactions. In the future, Qubic will leverage the world-wide available, unused computation capacity to solve all kinds of computational problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Oracles</strong></p>\n<p>In our pursuit of demand driven supply networks, we asked ourselves how weather conditions or events might impact demand in local stores? How could we factor in local conditions in demand predictions and supply decisions? IOTA and qubic introduce Oracles, that serve as trusted sources of distributed data external to the IOTA Tangle that provide the input for quorum-based computational tasks. Examples of such external data could be temperature and air quality data, exchange rates or share prices, or personal attributed such as age, martial status or brand preferences.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></p>\n<p>Oracles may also feed smart contracts. It is expected that in the future smart contracts largely replace real-world paper contracts and drive process automation by eliminating the need for third party enforcement and validation. Smart contracts could not only model contracts in a distributed network and trigger transfer of ownership and associated payments, but could also model incentive structures and business policies. However, the distributed computing model and outsourced computations of Qubic open up entirely new possibilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Qubics</strong></p>\n<p>Individual cubics are in essence pre-packaged quorum-based computational tasks.The Qubic protocol specifies the construction, execution, and evolutionary life-cycle of Qubics. It leverages the IOTA protocol for secure, trusted data transfer between the various participants in an open, distributed network. IOTA also has its own built-in payment system. where the IOTA tokens are used to pay for computational resources and provide an incentive system for Qubic operators.</p>\n<p>Just like we envisioned more than 15 years ago, Qubics are event-driven. They &lsquo;listen&rsquo; to new data and transactions on the IOTA tangle and get triggered whenever the input data changes. One Qubic can trigger a resulting cubic to execute based on its output. Essentially, Qubic enables a distributed computing model and distributed artificial intelligence that would run based on the trusted, validated and immutable data on the IOTA Tangle. A range of computing devices can form assemblies that cluster a range of computational resources around a given task. A novel, function-based programming language called ABRA will enable Qubics to run on virtually any hardware to make use of an almost limitless pool of generic computational resources. Variety of consensus mechanism can used to establish trust in data and computational results.</p>\n<p>Qubic is another important milestone in the evolution of the IOTA tangle, the world&rsquo;s first distributed ledger based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that promises to address the existing limitations of blockchain architectures around scalability, transaction fees and energy consumption. In essence, Qubic makes the IOTA Tangle programmable and introduces a distributed computing environment where machines can establish trust, share data and pay each other for any resource using fee-less micro-transactions.</p>\n<p>As somebody who prefers holistic thinking over details orientation, I am truly impressed by the vision of the IOTA founders. The Qubic vision is a major steps towards making IOTA a complete platform. With Qubic, a range of pieces that in themselves have been impressive solutions to real-world limitations of blockchain technologies come together to form a holistic platform for distributed computing, distributed artificial intelligence and swarm intelligence, leveraging a rich set of trusted, immutable and shared data stored in the IOTA Tangle.</p>\n<p>Given my background in Supply Chain Management and Industrial IoT, I am still interested in the space. After all, our work at SAP on &ldquo;Real-world Aware Adaptive Supply Networks&rdquo; had a lasting impact on me. But I am already exploring the implications of qubic on my new passion&hellip; stay tuned for my thoughts on how qubic will power the future of connected, autonomous, shared and electric mobility. In the meantime, I wish my SAP friends, customers and partners a great Sapphire 2018!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/iota-qubic-start-new-era-fulfillment-long-time-dream-alexander-renz/?published=t">IOTA and Qubic &ndash; The Start of New Era (and the Fulfillment of a Long Time Dream)</a><span> was originally published on </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">linkedin.com</a><span>.The IOTA-News Community curates, examines, and summarizes news from external services while producing its own original material.

        content: '<p>Strategic Business Innovator Group (SBI), Japanese financial giant, announced that its in-house cryptocurrency exchange is now live,  after a long delay caused by safety concerns. SBI has launched its VCTRADE service which will focus on the trading of XRP, the indigenous token derived from the Ripple protocol, and the trade will sequentially add supports for bitcoin and bitcoin cash.</p>\n<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sbigroup.co.jp/english/" rel="nofollow">SBI Group</a> is s a financial services company group based in Tokyo, Japan. SBI Group began in 1999 as SoftBank Investment, as a Softbank subsidiary at that time. SBI is listed on the first section of the Osaka Securities Exchange and Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s major business is placed as the “Financial Service Business,” which provides financial products and related services mainly based on securities, banking, insurance and housing loans; the “Asset Management Business,” which invests in Japanese and overseas venture companies in the fields of IT, biotechnology, environment/energy and finance; and the “Biotechnology-related Business,” which develops cosmetics, health foods and drug discovery globally.</p>\n<p>In October 2017, SBI Holdings announced launching its wholly-owned subsidiary &#8211; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbivc.co.jp/" rel="nofollow">SBI Virtual Currencies</a> &#8211; in order to provide the first cryptocurrency exchange that had the full support of a major financial institution.</p>\n<p>However, SBI Virtual Currencies&#8217; registration with Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency (FSA) was completed only in the end of September 2017. In a month, the company <a target="_blank" href="https://coinspeaker.com/2017/10/27/wirex-partners-sbi-holdings-launch-bitcoin-card-japan/" rel="nofollow">partnered</a> with London crypto-payments company Wirex. The aim of the partnership was to provide Japanese customers with bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment cards.</p>\n<p>In February of this year SBI announced that the opening would be delayed because of security concerns amid the Coincheck hack in late January. Moreover, the new service comes after SBI Virtual Currencies has canceled a partnership in March with crypto exchange Huobi that would use the latter&#8217;s financial and technological resources to launch VCTRADE.</p>\n<p>According to the<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbivc.co.jp/topics/pdf/20180604_release.pdf" rel="nofollow"> press release</a>, VCTRADE is currently only open for about 20,000 users who have pre-registered with the platform in October 2017. The company expects the service to be accessible for a larger public in July of this year.</p>\n<p>VCTRADE will start with the trading of Ripple’s token XRP.  Yoshitaka Kitao, President and CEO of SBI holdings, is very optimistic about this currency. He said: “XRP has a very clear use-case. It is faster, cheaper and more scalable than any other digital asset. I strongly believe it will become the global standard in digital currencies.”</p>\n<p>Later, SBI will work towards supporting bitcoin and bitcoin cash.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinspeaker.com/2018/06/04/sbi-japan-soft-launches-worlds-first-bank-backed-crypto-exchange/">SBI Japan Soft-Launches the World&#8217;s First Bank-Backed Crypto Exchange</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinspeaker.com">CoinSpeaker</a>.</p>',

        title: 'Are Bitcoin transactions instant?',
        content: '<p>While Bitcoin and other transactions have been (accurately) punted as a fast and reliable means of exchange, a common question is often whether Bitcoin transactions are as instant as (or faster than) bank transfers.</p>\n<p>The short answer to this question is no. The Bitcoin network is capable of processing a finite number of transactions per &#8216;block&#8217;, which network participants (<a href="https://www.coininsider.com/what-is-bitcoin-mining/">called miners</a>) will verify. The process of verifying a block and listing transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain can take as long as ten minutes.</p>\n<p>While this is inherently faster than the length of time a cross-border transfer may take (which can be under the jurisdiction of numerous authorities, banks, governments, or other regulators) Bitcoin transactions can be slower than bank transfers or conventional payments to a merchant or service provider.</p>\n<h3>Why do Bitcoin transactions take ten minutes?</h3>\n<p>When transacting in Bitcoin, miners receive transaction fees as profits for their labor. Typically, a transacting party may stipulate a higher fee to incentivize miners to verify their transaction ahead of all others.</p>\n<p>In the event a participant wishes to cancel a transaction, they can issue a request to the Bitcoin network with a higher transaction fee than their initial exchange &#8211; ensuring that miners are incentivized to cancel the transaction before it is processed, verified, and &#8216;confirmed&#8217;.</p>\n<p>In such instances, transacting parties may wish to see a transferred allocation of Bitcoin &#8216;confirmed&#8217; a set number of times.</p>\n<h3>What are &#8216;confirmations&#8217;?</h3>\n<p>To exemplify, let&#8217;s pretend John wishes to send one Bitcoin to Jane. Once John has issued the transaction, the transaction itself remains &#8216;unconfirmed&#8217;. Once another block has been created and another batch of transactions verified (where John&#8217;s transaction is listed), the transaction is said to be confirmed &#8216;once&#8217;.</p>\n<p>In a somewhat similar fashion to a team of human auditors verifying transactions or the exchange of funds, new &#8216;confirmations&#8217; are added after each subsequent block is added to the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>\n<p>Typically, most cryptocurrency exchanges require three confirmations before newly received funds can be used &#8211; while some investors may even require as much as 60 confirmations before they consider a transaction adequately &#8216;confirmed&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Given that new blocks are added roughly every ten minutes, it usually takes an hour to accommodate six confirmations.</p>\n<p>Many companies handling Bitcoin wallets or accepting Bitcoin as currency will require more than one confirmation before they will be willing to accept a trade as concluded. This is done so that the likelihood of a payment being reversed is mitigated.</p>\n<h3>How can I check &#8216;confirmations&#8217;?</h3>\n<p>Checking the number of confirmations on a transaction is simple. Once a party makes a transaction in Bitcoin, they are provided with a string of alphanumeric characters called a Transaction ID.</p>\n<p>Parties can examine the recorded details of their transactions on a chain analysis tool such as <a href="http://www.blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a>. When doing so, the number of confirmations processed by the Bitcoin network will be visible.</p>\n<h3>Can transactions be &#8216;lost&#8217;, or unconfirmed?</h3>\n<p>In some cases &#8211; or during peak congestion on the Bitcoin network &#8211; a transaction can &#8216;lag&#8217; and may not be processed for more than 72 hours. In some cases, delays make take even longer than that.</p>\n<p>Users in this situation have the option of issuing a request to cancel the transaction, or can re-broadcast the same transaction to incentivize a miner to process the exchange more quickly.</p>\n<h3>Will the Bitcoin network get faster?</h3>\n<p>&#8216;Scaling&#8217; &#8211; expanding the Bitcoin network to handle more transactions, and the requests of more users &#8211; is a contentious debate.</p>\n<p>Some proponents have argued that Bitcoin requires a <a href="https://www.coininsider.com/lightning-network/">&#8220;second layer&#8221; solution</a> (that is, a transactional network built atop the Bitcoin network) to handle smaller &#8216;microtransactional&#8217; payments &#8211; such as buying a cup of coffee from a barista. Through doing so, Bitcoin transactions may become faster as less stress is placed upon the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>\n<p>Other parties have argued that Bitcoin doesn&#8217;t require a second layer, and that instead the Bitcoin network needs to be able to handle more transactions per second. <a href="https://www.coininsider.com/will-bitcoin-or-bitcoin-cash-succeed/">Such parties have argued</a> that by increasing the size of blocks, more transactions can be accommodated every ten minutes.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coininsider.com/are-bitcoin-transactions-instant/">Are Bitcoin transactions instant?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coininsider.com">Coin Insider</a>.</p>',

Also to note is that there will be <strong>a scheduled Tron Hackathon in the month of September this year</strong> to further the security efforts on the MainNet platform. Developers will test vulnerabilities in the network and the Tron foundation will <a href="https://medium.com/@Tronfoundation/mainnet-launch-livestream-5-31-recap-7e0a8ab15509">set aside millions</a> of dollars as rewards for any individual or developer teams that manage to find any.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">Also in the month of September, will be a Tron Developer&#8217;s Convention that is to be organized by the Tron foundation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">Recapping on the events on the <a href="https://tron.network/index?lng=en">Tron</a> road-map for the month of June, we find that there is the token migration that begins on the 21st of June to the 24th.

With the bug bounty program also ongoing, the MainNet is being tested for vulnerabilities with the Genesis Block scheduled for the launch on the 25th of June.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">This means that the month of June will be an eventful month for the Tron project and token.

They have been touring around Africa with the #TransformAfrica motive in places like Ethiopia and Rwanda. The team has been updating about the progress and are moving closer to their vision.</p>\n<p>Input Output tweeted another update earlier today:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vision for #blockchain in #Africa is becoming a reality &#8211; Ethiopia and Rwanda are keen to realize the promise of the technology. Read about the recent achievements for #Cardano in Africa on the blog from @jjtoconnor, IOHK Director of African Operations.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>This long-term vision has existed longer than IOHK itself. John O&rsquo;Connor, the director of African Operations mentioned how Charles Hoskinson&rsquo;s talk about this in a TEDx event in 2014 encouraged him to join the Cardano project. He spoke about the mutual vision to make Africa a better and advanced nation.</p>\n<p>Rick McCracken, a Twitterati says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is great news Charles. You really are making the world a better place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>IOHK and the Ethiopian government agreed mutually and signed a MoU to train and hire fresh software developers as they plan to use Cardano in its agriculture industry. The actual work begins now with the use of Cardano to solve real-world problems in Ethiopia and beyond. The training course and hiring plans as agreed by Charles, the founder of IOHK, and the idea to introduce Cardano in Ethiopian agriculture is the first of its kind ever in Africa.</p>\n<p>The classes are planned to begin around September, expecting 30 women developers on the inaugural class. The trainees will then be hired based on their performance. The criteria will not only be restricted to the contribution to Cardano&rsquo;s code but also the support to build the blockchain agriculture apps. The opportunity to make an impact on blockchain is huge with more than 80 million Ethiopians working in the industry.</p>\n<p>John O&#8217;Connor expressed his gratitude stating:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I thank the IOHK and Emurgo teams who flew out to be on the ground and help us establish our work.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>He continued:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But most importantly, I&rsquo;d like to thank Yodahe Zemichael from the Science Technology and Information Centre and Dr Getahun Mekuria, Minister of Science and Technology. You have been more agile, proactive, and enthusiastic partners than we could have hoped for. We look forward to working with you.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com/cardano-ada-step-closer-transform-africa-vision-reality/">Cardano [ADA] is one step closer to turn &#8220;Transform Africa&#8221; vision into reality</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com">AMBCrypto</a>.</p>',

If you host a &ldquo;Q-Node&rdquo;, a node that supports the Q protocol (layer) you can earn rewards in these manners: Offering PoW (mining rigs, computer, or your coffee pot), PoS (your IOTA&rsquo;s that you hold), your bandwidth that you don&rsquo;t use (probably something to do with LIFI in the future, so this could be your router and lightbulbs in your house), and simply, the previous history of running an honest node for the&nbsp;system.</p>\n<p>All of the above can be used to pass the &ldquo;resource test phase&rdquo;. All of those resources: PoW, PoS, Po(Bandwidth), and Po(Honesty) are measured and quantified. Your resources than essentially set you in an equivalent resource pool ie: in a pool with other people of similar resource&nbsp;power.</p>\n<p>You then earn IOTA&rsquo;s from people using the Oracle system, smart contract, or simply who want computational power (which is absolutely needed to be able to outsource the IoT industry which is for sure the&nbsp;future.</p>\n<p>So what does that&nbsp;mean.</p>\n<p>Before do you remember all of the questions: IOTA won&rsquo;t work because people won&rsquo;t run nodes, because they don&rsquo;t get incentives like traditional blockchains. Well now they can!!! And not only that, &ldquo;Q&rdquo; takes every aspect of each crypto and combines it all in&nbsp;one&hellip;</p>\n<p>PoS, PoW, PoBandwidth, and PoHonesty.</p>\n<p>More so, if you have Asic&rsquo;s, you are in the Asic&rsquo;s pool, GPU&rsquo;s, your in the GPU pool, old crappy computer (your in the old crappy computer pool), you stake a lot of IOTA, your in the high stake IOTA pool&hellip;&nbsp;etc.</p>\n<p>People will purchase &ldquo;resources&rdquo; using the Qubic protocol. If they want quality, fast, or extreme computational power they have to&nbsp;pay.</p>\n<p>Remember, you the user set what you want to receive in IOTA for your resources (economic principles). If you spend $1200 a month on electricity and equipment, you will only charge more than $1200 a month. No one would charge less. So in your pool, everyone will eventually come to a quorum charging a set amount, and thus the economy (the users) will pay for it. So in essence, the better the pool, the more the reward you get (based on economic principals in society (just like blockchain).</p>\n<p>However, if your coffee pot has a jinn chip that is Ternary hardware, with Ternary programming (ABRA), than it can sell it&rsquo;s resources when it&rsquo;s not making coffee ie:&nbsp;PoW.</p>\n<p>Also, your autonomous car not only can offer up its PoW, it can also stake the IOTA&rsquo;s it is not using in it&rsquo;s wallet, the bandwidth when it isn&rsquo;t working or driving, and the experience / honesty factor it has as a node, and even the electricity it made from it&rsquo;s solar power roof and sell it to the grid. Your car has &ldquo;multiple&rdquo; resources. The Qubic network allows machines to offer &ldquo;all&rdquo; of their resources, not just one or two like blockchain.</p>\n<p>Qubics revolutionizes machinery allowing it, the machinery, to sell it&rsquo;s resources. This is another building block to the ultimate vision of a machines acting in a &ldquo;machine economy&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Rather than us setting this up, and the fees we want to charge, eventually we can create smart contracts with Qubic functions, so the machines can negotiate and earn &ldquo;themselves&rdquo;, the machines will sell and buy resources THEMSELVES, truly creating a machine economy, &ldquo;AND&rdquo; if you own the machine, you earn the rewards (ie: income, passive&nbsp;income).</p>\n<p>Take Away&nbsp;Two:</p>\n<p>2. From the above description these are only a few use cases that I take away from reading about Qubics. The reality is that the community will be coming up with new use cases every day for the following year probably. Use cases that we can&rsquo;t even imagine, but here is my second takeaway:</p>\n<p>The Qubic protocol, where all this is happening. Miners earning, people staking their IOTA and earning (ie: &ldquo;interest&rdquo; or &ldquo;passive income&rdquo;) because they are HODLER&rsquo;s, Forex financial companies using Qubics for quorum &ldquo;ORACLE&rdquo; data, smart-contracts being run on the protocol, scientist using computational power for medical research, VW and Bosch using computational power for their IoT devices, etc. on and on. All those use cases, to power&hellip;. TO POWER, to run the network, all of those functions will be conducted with zero fee transactions that take place on the&nbsp;Tangle.</p>\n<p>The whole system runs on data transactions (zero fee transactions) by sending MetaData on the transaction which is sent on the Tangle. Meta Data essentially (I&rsquo;m not a techie) is like the language that tells the Q-Nodes to wake up, to process data, pay, earn, and receive, and essentially run the whole Q&nbsp;network.</p>\n<p>So&hellip;. that is a SHITLOAD OF FUCKING transactions occurring!!!!!! So the present day amount of transactions right now occuring from Trinity, speculation, and trading, is like a pissing in the ocean compared to how many transactions the Qubic network will produce. Its not hard to understand, the Qubic network will run millions if not billions of transactions per day over the Tangle, and remember, &ldquo;each transaction confirms two transactions <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#128521;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<p>So&hellip;. what does that mean. More transactions means a faster Tangle, a more secure Tangle&hellip;. and most importantly&hellip;. WE CAN TAKE THE COO (Coordinator) OFFLINE!!!</p>\n<p>note: there may be use cases for multiple COO&rsquo;s (coordinators) or private COO&rsquo;s but that is a whole other arena and I simply state that from something I read from someone on&nbsp;Discord.</p>\n<p>The point is: Q is needed to remove the&nbsp;COO!</p>\n<p>So everyone saying, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t the dev&rsquo;s fucking working on removing the COO, &ldquo;wen remove COO&rdquo;, you can see that THEY ARE working on it!&rdquo;. The Qubic network will support the network because it incentives people to host nodes and earn&nbsp;IOTA!.</p>\n<p>Also, if no one uses the Qubic network then it doesn&rsquo;t work right?!? So making &ldquo;Corporate Partners&rdquo;, and United Nations (NGO) affiliates, is needed to support the Qubic&nbsp;Network.</p>\n<p>So here are the building blocks to the dev&rsquo;s&nbsp;vision:</p>\n<p>&ndash; You need a Tangle (Zero fee transactions that can that can send meta data)<br />\n&ndash; You need IOTA (A form of payment that can buy and sell resources (ie: PoW, PoS, PoBandwidth, and PoHonesty)<br />\n&ndash; You need the Qubic Network (creates Oracles, allows for Quorum Based Computations that powers Oracles.)<br />\n&ndash; You need Oracles (Oracles power smart-contracts which is the whole shabang! It will change society and change global finance).<br />\n&ndash; You need the Qubic Network (creates Oracles, this allows for Quorum Based Computations that powers Oracles.)et to enjoy because the IF includes us (with AMA&rsquo;s, takes time in discord, and offers transparency), and global partners such as Bosch, VW, Fujitsu, etc., We need governments and societies such as Taiwan, Denmark, and maybe Sweden; and we need banking like DnB, and electrical companies like Elaad (I think I stated ELaad incorrectly). We need the global integration to actually &ldquo;use&rdquo; the Qubic system for it to work (demand drives economic principals, which ultimately will pay the Q-Node providers)<br />\n&ndash; Lastly, you need to remove the COO and let the network grow organically. (This can only be done when all of the previous steps have been completed).</p>\n<p>Tangle -&gt;IOTA -&gt;Qubic Network -&gt;Oracles -&gt;Partners -&gt;&nbsp;COO</p>\n<p>So removing the COO is one of the last steps. After removing COO the network can just grow organically on it&rsquo;s own without much support or help from the dev&rsquo;s. They can then work on building applications that work on top of the Qubic&nbsp;network.</p>\n<p>This is a large challenging undertaking that is being built step-by-step, each piece is part of a large puzzle that all comes together. As for Qubic&rsquo;s, what was just released, it is a really large damn piece of that puzzle!!!</p>\n<p>It just goes to show, that all of this adds up to removing the COO. Everything the dev&rsquo;s, and the IF, have been doing are working towards simply that! It&rsquo;s all one big construct, not different pieces, everything ties together and the Qubic network is a large friggin piece of it all. Their sole mission is to complete the puzzle, the vision, so the COO can be removed, and the Tangle can literally change society through the machine&nbsp;economy.</p>\n<p>This is just my non-techie understanding at the moment. I have a lot more research and studying to do, but damn I love it! So glad to be apart of this&nbsp;journey</p>\n<p>Please clarify if I totally misunderstood anything, and looking forward to hear other peoples understanding.</p>\n<p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6387b18267d2" width="1" height="1" /></p>\n</p>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://medium.com/@jamesjdsutton/what-is-q-from-a-laymen-given-barney-style-6387b18267d2?source=rss-36f97abac343------2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">What is &ldquo;Q&rdquo; from a laymen given Barney style&hellip;</a> was originally published on <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesjdsutton?source=rss-36f97abac343------2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://medium.com/@jamesjdsutton?source=rss-36f97abac343&#8212;&#8212;2</a>.

The IOTA protocol was, in fact, created to help solve those problems. Indeed, IOTA was designed to become the global standard for IoT messaging and payments. Qubic follows that standard, and is made possible by fee-free IOTA transactions,&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Originally conceived in a September 2012 <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=112676.0">post</a> on BitcoinTalk, Qubic &mdash; or Quorum Based Coin &mdash; denotes the idea of a cryptocurrency offering all the utility of Bitcoin, with none of its disadvantages.</p>\n<p>While building on this concept, the IOTA team have quickly <a href="https://qubic.iota.org/">disclaimed</a> that IOTA&rsquo;s Qubic will not employ a new token or any form of airdrop.</p>\n<h2>Qubic: IOTA&rsquo;s Secret Weapon?<strong><br /></strong></h2>\n<p>While IOTA has <a href="https://www.iota.org/the-foundation/our-vision">positioned</a> itself primarily as &ldquo;Enabling the true Internet-of-Things,&rdquo; the reported functionality of Qubic would suggest loftier heights are in sight.</p>\n<p>In a manner remarkably close to Ethereum&rsquo;s mission statement, IOTA <a href="https://qubic.iota.org/intro">describes</a> how Qubic will ultimately &ldquo;secure the IOTA Tangle: an IOTA-based world supercomputer.&rdquo; When described in detail, it can be seen how deep the (Qubic) rabbit hole goes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Specifically, Qubic is a protocol that specifies IOTA&rsquo;s solution for quorum-based computations, including such constructs as oracle machines, outsourced computations, and smart contracts. Qubic provides general-purpose, cloud- or fog-based, permissionless, multiprocessing capabilities on the Tangle.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, Qubic&rsquo;s broad scope would transform IOTA into a regular dynamo &mdash; a jack of all trades up against a plethora of blockchain-based rivals: smart contract platforms, distributed computing networks, oracle networks, messaging platforms, peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies, and more.</p>\n<p>The IOTA Foundation&rsquo;s track record of execution and recent momentum would certainly lend IOTA enthusiasts enough reason to place their faith in Qubic.</p>\n</article>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/iota-unveils-qubic-the-key-to-an-iota-based-world-supercomputer/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IOTA Unveils Qubic: The Key to an &ldquo;IOTA-based World Supercomputer?&rdquo;</a> was originally published on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cryptoslate.com/</a>.

        content: '<p>In a new OmiseGo AMA session, Vitalik Buterin has once again staked his belief that second-layer solutions will enable Ethereum to handle more than one million transactions per second.</p>\n<p>During the AMA, Buterin noted that second-layer solutions such as Plasma and Sharing could be crucial in expanding Ethereum&#8217;s reach. While Plasma enables Ethereum to handle &#8216;micropayments&#8217; through child blockchains, Sharding divides a blockchain network to sections &#8211; or &#8216;shards&#8217; &#8211; which relieves nodes of having to process all new data items recorded on a blockchain.</p>\n<p><em>“The reason I think layer 1 and layer 2 [networks] are complementary is because ultimately, if you look at the math, the scalability gains from the layer 1 improvements and layer 2 improvements do ultimately multiply with each other&#8221;, </em>Buterin said.</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qD-IbiVpcT8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;If you have a Sharding solution, the Sharding solution itself might increase the scalability of Ethereum by a factor of 100, or eventually even more. But then, if you do Plasma on top of the scalability solution, then what that means is, you’re not just doing 100 times of the amount of activity but you are doing 100 times the amount of entrances, the amount of exits, and despite resolutions.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“So if you get a 100x from Sharding and a 100x from Plasma, those two basically give you a 10,000x scalability gain, which basically means blockchains will be powerful enough to handle most applications most people are trying to do with them”.</em></p>\n<p>Buterin has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSN5BaCzsbo">previously expressed his beliefs</a> when speaking with venture capital investor Naval Ravikant at TechCrunch&#8217;s Disrupt SF conference in 2017, while Buterin unveiled a new scaling solution in the form of<a href="https://www.coininsider.com/vitalik-buterin-unveils-plasma-cash-a-new-blockchain-scaling-solution/"> Plasma Cash</a> earlier this year.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.coininsider.com/coin/eth">Ether</a> is up by 1.26% day-on-day, and at press time trades at $607.54 USD.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coininsider.com/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-second-layer-one-million-transactions/">Buterin: Second-layer solutions could help Ethereum achieve one million transactions per second</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coininsider.com">Coin Insider</a>.</p>',

It doesn&rsquo;t explain much though.</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6K0xQgaCAg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>\n<p>IOTA&nbsp;was launched in 2015.&nbsp;It is one of the more valuable cryptocurrencies out there, with a market capitalisation of $4.8 billion according to <em>coinmarketcap.com</em>. At one point it even surpassed Ripple, although that particular spike in price was at least partly due to a misunderstanding regarding the company&rsquo;s relationship with Microsoft.</p>\n<p>It is a cryptocurrency designed to be faster than Bitcoin by using a unique kind of network which it calls &lsquo;the Tangle&rsquo;. It works quickly because a new block of data is added automatically with every transaction, and these transactions can take place off-chain to be added later. Mining/verification is conducted by small groups of users who have been delegated the task.</p>\n<p>IOTA has higher aims than being a cryptocurrency though &ndash; it wants to create an &lsquo;internet-of-things&rsquo;. This is a concept where all devices are connected and controlled by the internet. To this end, IOTA has been developing a mysterious protocol called Qubic.</p>\n<h2><strong>Qubic</strong></h2>\n<p>The word Qubic comes from the acronym for &lsquo;quorum-based-computing&rsquo;. A quorom is the minimum number of participants necessary to make the proceedings of a given meeting valid, which is a principle that can also apply to distributed ledger technology.</p>\n<p>According to the official&nbsp; website, Qubic (big Q) is a protocol which will connect the world to the Tangle. Specific operations that take place within the protocol are called qubics. Qubics (small q) can do many things but they all work on the same principle.</p>\n<p>They work through what IOTA calls an &lsquo;oracle machines&rsquo;, which read and transmit data from the real world. This could mean election results, a human being&rsquo;s personal attributes, the weather. The qubics process that information, their main purpose being to ensure its consistency and reliability via consensus.</p>\n<p>IOTA considers users to be one type of oracle machine (&ldquo;the external actors such as users, or machines that provide sensor data&rdquo;). So for those that enjoy fancy job titles, you may not be able to surpass what IOTA offers here.</p>\n<p>The Qubic protocol also allows people to outsource computing, which means that devices can ask other devices to compute for them. One assigns a task to an available machine using a qubic programme, which will relay your instructions and the returning results while ensuring &ldquo;that the results can be trusted to a high degree of certainty.&rdquo; Users can also offer their computing power to others.</p>\n<p>At this point it should be noted that Qubic is not a currency. There will be no ICO, and no tokens to buy. IOTA has not yet specified what the incentive would be to offer computing power.</p>\n<p>Smart contracts are also a big part of the Qubic system. Introduced to the public by Ethereum, smart contracts are computer-based contracts which are popular because they are inherently free and fair, eliminating as they do the need for an unreliable human as a third party.</p>\n<p>According to IOTA, Qubic will take these one step further: &ldquo;While Qubic is of course capable of supporting these kinds of traditional smart contracts, the combination of fee-free transactions together with general-purpose quorum-based computation opens the door to entirely new possibilities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>These possibilities involve the internet-of-things. An oracle such as yourself could report weather data to the Tangle. The qubits take the data from users, make an average and publish it in the network. &ldquo;The smart contract has now become an oracle in and of itself &ndash; that is, the contract itself has become a source of external data.&rdquo; This describes a kind of chain of information reliance. Another example would be exchange rate gathering, leading to market movement prediction, leading to portfolio management decisions.</p>\n<div class="bs-shortcode bs-text ">\n<div class="bs-text-content">\n<p>IOTA says that Qubic &ldquo;will be a platform for the greater community and ecosystem to create things we can&rsquo;t even imagine yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has been working on it for &ldquo;quite a while internally&rdquo; and will be giving it priority over the next two years..</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/iota-releases-details-major-project-qubic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IOTA Releases Details of Major Project, Qubic</a> was originally published on <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.financemagnates.com/</a>.

However, it will make its services available to a wider audience from next month i.e. July. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SBI </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/news/altcoin-news/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual Currencies</a> is the wholly owned subsidiary of SBI Holdings which marks the first cryptocurrency exchange of the country that is backed by a major financial institution. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, in September, the platform completed its registration with the Financial Services Agency (FSA).  However, amidst the Coincheck hack, the launch got delayed due to security concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We offer the lowest-delay trading environment of the world highest level using Tem (matching engine)”, reads the official announcement. Offering a free transaction fee, the exchange does apply a withdrawal fee that will be charged at the time of withdrawal.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Also, read: <a title="3 Latest Reasons Ripple [XRP] Demands Attention" href="https://coingape.com/reasons-ripple-coin-xrp-demands-attention/?utm_source=read_more&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="bookmark">3 Latest Reasons<span class="highlighted"> Ripple</span> [XRP] Demands Attention</a></strong></span></em></p>\n<h3><b>XRP focused trading, making its way to $1 </b></h3>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the first step in this direction, the exchange would focus on the trading of XRP. The official website has already provided information on the <strong>XRP</strong> which is the only cryptocurrency supported by the exchange right one. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is no surprise as the news has been doing the rounds for a long time. Also, given the fact that SBI Holdings is already working with Ripple technology for cross-border transactions, this was expected.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exchange will further add support for <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-down-gear-up-for-bull-rally/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin </a>(BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). But the timeline for the same is not shared yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://coingape.com/japanese-conglomerate-sbi-group-now-mines-bitcoin-cash-bch/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBI</a> Holdings has the largest Internet securities account and with such a customer base, the competition in the market is only going to get more fierce. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an exclusive pairing with JPY, this is a huge opportunity for XRP which is among the few ones in the market right now that is in the green at $0.66. XRP is gaining a lot of attention and adoption, which is a significant factor in its long-term success. </span></p>\n<p><strong>What your views on SBI’s virtual currency exchange?

Some were even stranded in traffic as they were unable to pay for their toll using their cards.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">One VISA customer by the name of Adam had this to say to the BBC about the whole experience:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style="text-align: justify">We have spent all day boating to moor up at a riverside pub in Kidlington for a birthday meal only to find the visa payments are not working. Having only £20 between us we have had to opt for a birthday drink instead. [There is] no cash point for miles around and no car as we are on the canal boat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style="text-align: justify">In Glasgow, another VISA customer, Deborah Eldar, had this to say when interviewed by the BBC:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style="text-align: justify">I was so embarrassed. I gave the waiter the 14 euros I had left. I&#8217;m worried I won&#8217;t be able to get home when I land in Toulouse as I have no cash for a taxi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style="text-align: justify">VISA would later confirm that services were back to normal and gave the explanation of hardware failure as earlier mentioned.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">Such an outage has led many crypto enthusiast and believers <a href="https://www.ccn.com/op-ed-visa-vs-cryptocurrency-its-only-a-matter-of-time/">to reinforce their long held views</a> that the time is nigh for cryptocurrencies to replace all other forms of traditional payment. The decentralized background of the crypto-verse does not depend on the centralized systems seen in the described VISA incident.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">VISA runs on a select group of private servers that can leave the network crippled if they are affected by a malicious hack or hardware failure. Such servers usually have redundancy systems but sometimes, getting them to handle the network traffic after a failure, takes some time. Time that leaves many users stranded as is the case with the VISA outage described.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">With decentralized systems, the nodes of the network are all over the globe. If the hardware at one location were to crash, the network would divert the transactions to another node. The only issue with blockchain technology is network congestion since the network can only handle a limited number of transactions per second. This becomes a problem as has been seen numerous times on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">However, with talks of scaling by the <a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/here-is-how-trons-trx-mainnet-will-be-better-than-ethereums-platform/">Tron (TRX)</a> foundation as well as <a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/what-exactly-is-zilliqa-zil/">Zilliqa (ZIL)</a> team and Ethereum (ETH) Foundation, delayed transactions will be a thing of the past.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">In conclusion, the VISA network issue caused a lot of panic in Europe that could have been avoided if the payment stations had integrated cryptocurrency payment options.</p>\n<h6 style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Disclaimer: This article is not meant to give financial advice.

It will also serve as a marketplace where consumers and distributors can purchase or rent this original premium content. Built on the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum blockchain</a>, the platform uses virtual tokens to securely record every project&rsquo;s progress and guarantee that every team member has a stake in the project. Qravity then distributes profits derived from finished content among its creators and project founder according to their respective stakes.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The company&rsquo;s founder and CEO, David Brandstaetter, explained to Cointelegraph: &ldquo;Qravity tracks tasks in such a way that creative members receive stakes in the content they help make. For example, a person who writes lyrics for a song gets a share, say five percent, of the song&rsquo;s revenue. Every time someone buys that song, the lyricist gets five percent of that payment.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Content creators receive an immutable and transparent record of their project stakes in the form of a digital token known as QPT, an asset which is used internally within the ecosystem and cannot be purchased on crypto exchanges. Project founders allocate fixed amounts of QPT to tasks according to their own criteria, such as task complexity or the estimated time required for a task to be completed. Founders can also set the amount of QPT they themselves receive upon project completion.</p>\n\n<p>Qravity&rsquo;s cryptocurrency is called QCO; within its ecosystem, individuals and distributors can use it to license or purchase content directly. Royalties from these sales are then distributed according to each project member&rsquo;s QPT holdings.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Helping content creators make a living</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">To emphasise one of the benefits of its platform, <a  href="https://qravity.com/en/" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Qravity</a> highlights the case of the 19th-century poet and author Edgar Allan Poe. His poem The Raven received critical acclaim in 1845 and is still internationally renowned and celebrated to this day. Despite this, he only earned $24 for his literary masterpiece &ndash; the equivalent of $754.91 when adjusted for inflation in 2018.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Mr Poe&rsquo;s earnings during his 20-year literary career would be worth a total of just $195,018 today. This in part motivated Mr. Brandstaetter, an Austrian composer and producer, to help today&rsquo;s creatives overcome the challenges that all too often deny them the chance to earn a living &ndash; hurdles such as unfair payment and copyright infringement.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Mr. Brandstaetter told Cointelegraph: &ldquo;I was speaking with my friend and business partner Sascha Dennstedt [Qravity&rsquo;s co-founder and CFO] about Poe and how, in some ways, little has changed financially for artists. He said that we should integrate blockchain into Qravity. Some research convinced me that this made perfect sense.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Project already in the pipeline</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Qravity says it plans to only host commercially viable content, reviewing all proposals for new projects carefully to ensure that stakeholders stand to make the highest possible profit.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The company completed is MVP in July 2017; later that year, Mr. Brandstaetter and his team began planning for blockchain integration.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Qravity&rsquo;s fast-approaching presale will offer a 30 percent bonus for early contributors. It is splitting its token sale into five rounds, with the first phase commencing two weeks after the presale&rsquo;s launch.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Production of Qravity&rsquo;s pilot project, a 3D animated feature film called Lizzard Maddoxx, will start in September 2018, with the company planning to release, distribute, and monetize the movie in September 2019. It will begin accepting proposals for new content in January 2019, after it updates the platform according to beta testing results.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div id="post-content">\n<p><span style="font-size: 12px; color: rgb(169, 169, 169);"><span style="font-weight: 600">Disclaimer.</span> Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

        title: 'Tron [TRX]’s timeline flashback and post main net improvements',
        content: '<p>Tron Main Net was launched successfully on the 31st of May and the news is still fresh across the globe. The main net launch ushered a whole new chapter to the Tron community as they crossed a milestone and the most awaited one.</p>\n<p>They are now approaching the token migration which is expected to happen on June 25th. Tron will depart from the Ethereum network and ERC-20 tokens to enter a new network. Their blockchain protocol is the biggest in the world and the technology promises to revolutionize the entire crypto world and support the strong vision of making Tron [TRX] the world&rsquo;s best currency. Post token swap, Tron will proudly flaunt its TRC-20 coin as they are ready to set a standard for themselves and the entire community.</p>\n<p>With more than 20 exchanges including the top and most popular ones supporting this migration act, users are bound to have a seamless shift to experience a whole new payment system. Additionally, Tron&rsquo;s project genesis is seemingly a huge part of Tron&rsquo;s growth with the network.</p>\n<p>Along with the support from various exchanges for a smooth transition of tokens, a lot of exchanges from around the world are coming forward to list TRX on their platform. The founder had also recently assured a lot more to be expected soon as they are slowly expanding over the boundaries and beyond their region. Malta and Indonesia are the biggest and the latest expansion schemes from Tron, looked up to from both ends.</p>\n<p>The next thing to look up to is the SR election that probably no other blockchain or coin has hosted so far. They have witnessed around 60 candidates coming forward to participate. They will choose 27 final representatives who will stand by Tron throughout its journey. The election process provides an experience for all the candidates of a truly democratic election process.</p>\n<p>These elected block producers will be responsible for maintaining Tron&rsquo;s network governance. The spread of candidates includes individuals and companies from various sectors like exchange platforms, mining pools, funds, community supporters, and developers. Hello World and Infinity Stones are the latest to join the list of candidates.</p>\n<p>The website has also been revamped to allow easy access to &ldquo;state of Tron DApps&rdquo;, a user-friendly layout running on Tron&rsquo;s protocol. Additional features like the Tron block explorer allows users to browse blockchains, node map, SR search, voting, and TRX market info along with support for address, block height, token id, and the token itself.</p>\n<p>This is all just the beginning, the main picture is still in the frame as they have a lot more exciting things to offer to the entire audience that includes developers, users, traders, and supporters.</p>\n<p>In a post, Justin Sun, the founder mentioned:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With constant growth of our team, contributions from the community developers and accomplishing each step in the roadmap, the expansion of the TRON ecosystem will continue to grow each day.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Adding on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With the support and effort by everyone to create and launch a successful main net, we are excited to bring both the community, and the world, so many new and innovative ways to use blockchain technology.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com/tron-trxs-timeline-flashback-and-post-main-net-improvements/">Tron [TRX]&#8217;s timeline flashback and post main net improvements</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com">AMBCrypto</a>.</p>',

        title: 'TRON Coin Goes Red: Hype & Security Issues Negatively Affecting Tron?',
        content: '<div class="optinengine_before_post"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new network reaching to around 2000 transactions per second, <strong>Tron coin</strong> (TRX) is all set for an exhilarating journey towards the top. But this clearly lies in counteractive viewpoint to come to light as what the markets observed after its mainnet’s launch, is a sharp decline in the crypto’s trade.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tron’s current value amounts to USD $0.059 experiencing a 4.1% dip in the trends. To sustain its future credibility, Tron regulators have decided to host coordinated hackathons to guarantee the MainNet’s security.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Tron coin mainnet launch did not live upto the expectations</strong></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When authorities rolled out the <a href="https://coingape.com/tron-mainnet-launch-trx-price-rise/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mainnet</a>, setting Tron coin apart from the <strong>ERC20</strong> <strong>tokens</strong>, the surges and hiking trends were expected out of this endeavor. But it turned out to be a reversed scenario where marking a sharp downfall of 74% since the all-time high, Tron is under great upheaval.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks that the idea of technology expansion that made Tron leave the Ethereum block previously did not sync with the endeavors that it aspired to fulfill. Rather, it ended up in a worst case scenario where it is in turns right now and struggling for its stability.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems to be a bug that is responsible for the ongoing nuisance. Despite the team’s adamancy for its network being bug-free, they have rolled out a bug bounty program guaranteeing the reporter $10 million as a reward.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Also, read: <a title="The EOS Mainnet Launch: Shall we deem it a success?

Not yet.</a></strong></span></em></p>\n<h3><strong>Seeking for collabs and agreements</strong></h3>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, to ensure the mainnet’s security, it seems that regulators are awaiting for mergers and seeking out for <a href="https://coingape.com/tron-coin-partnership-with-vsport-and-apple-stock-listing/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreements</a>. In the wake of this, hackathons can really prove to be of great help.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this September is awaited to witness a <strong>Tron hackathon</strong>, that can be significant enough to unmask the hidden prospects that Tron is undermined of. Various esteemed businesspersons, analysts, investors, exchanges and crypto enthusiasts have a keen eye on the event. Undoubtedly, this interest driven event is set to await, coming opportunities for Tron.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tron is introduced in the Indonesian <a href="https://coingape.com/us-crypto-exchange-bittrex-allows-buy-cryptos/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a>. With others, Tron is now live listed on 98 exchanges around the globe. This is yet another step in regards to its forward leap, so planned.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In wake of the popularity of Tron coin among investors, the surge is yet to come in short span of time. And the cryptocurrency will be up for yet another stark comeback that will soon roll out by the end of June, as suggested by the analysts and business enthusiasts.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the efforts and consolidatory position that the team abides by is yet to witness a positive response soon in real time.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you expect out the trend to be? Will it be rising, or on the contrary, continue to decline in sync with present time situation?</strong> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class="optinengine_after_post"></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coingape.com/tron-coin-goes-red-hype-affecting-tron/">TRON Coin Goes Red: Hype &#038; Security Issues Negatively Affecting Tron?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coingape.com">Coingape</a>.</p>',

It will expose the education community to many a number of use cases in the blockchain industry that can heighten research within the space.</p>\n<p>Owing to Ripple’s outstanding performance in the blockchain world, it is no doubt that it can perform excellently in the academic community and create nonexistent ideas in this space, the same manner it is doing in the fintech world.</p>\n<p>In so doing, Ripple has dedicated more than <strong>$50 million in funding</strong>, expertise and technical resources to UBRI’s maiden partners, which includes 17 internationally recognized institutions around the world.</p>\n<p>Among the first batch of partners is the <a href="https://www.unic.ac.cy/">University of Nicosia, Cyprus</a>, one of the frontrunner in blockchain education in the world. Also, it involves the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">The University of Pennsylvania</a> where UBRI is financing selected MBA-MS candidates yearly in a newly established Wharton-Engineering dual-degree program. The support will give students working on blockchain or cryptocurrency a top regard.</p>\n<p>In the same line, the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP), <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a> is saddled with the responsibility of creating an UBRI program that will research on the policy impact of cryptocurrencies and blockchain in the whole world.</p>\n<p>While the schools involved in UBRI will individually design their research topics and other necessary things, Ripple will finance the research and technical development to increase societal understanding of blockchain.</p>\n<p>Importantly, UBRI has linked Ripple with MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab’s new FinTech initiative that comprises close to a dozen respected companies in the financial services industry. With Ripple, they will be working with groups of CSAIL’s 116+ researchers on topics revolving around blockchain, cryptocurrencies, cybersecurity and global payments.</p>\n<p><strong>UBRI’s complete list of partners as </strong><a href="https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-introduces-the-university-blockchain-research-initiative/"><strong>published by Ripple</strong></a><strong> today:</strong></p>\n<p><a href="https://law.anu.edu.au/">Australian National University College of the Law</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.princeton.edu">CITP at Princeton</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL at MIT</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology (Netherlands)</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://portal.fgv.br/">Fundação Getulio Vargas (Brazil)</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.berkeley.edu">Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H)</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.korea.edu/">Korea University</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.utexas.edu">McCombs School of Business, UT-Austin</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.unc.edu">The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">The University of Pennsylvania</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL (University College London)</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://wwwen.uni.lu/">University of Luxembourg</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.unic.ac.cy">University of Nicosia (Cyprus)</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/ripple-xrp-enters-edtech-with-university-blockchain-research-initiative-around-20-top-univ-involved/">Ripple (XRP) Enters EdTech With University Blockchain Research Initiative, Around 20 Top Univ.

        title: '‘Sharding and Plasma to Help Ethereum Reach 1M Transactions per Second,’ Says Vitalik Buterin',
        content: '<p>From the very beginning, two major blockchain networks of Bitcoin and Ethereum have been facing the limited processing speed required for nodes to validate transactions executed on the networks. Considering the continuously growing community of cryptocurrency holders, the low transaction rate as well as increased operational costs have become a significant obstacle for the everyday usage of digital assets.</p>\n<p>The current speed of Bitcoin transactions is only 7 transactions per second, while Ethereum can process up to 15 transactions at peak capacity. However, even when Ethereum is able to execute twice the amount of Bitcoin transactions, it is still not good enough in order to shatter the highly set benchmark of the cost of transactions available on blockchain.</p>\n<p>In an effort to overcome issues with network congestion and overall throughput, the founder of Ethereum has announced two layer improvements, Sharding and Plasma, conceived to boost the network’s transaction capacity. Buterin claims it is only a matter of time until these primary solutions working in tandem will enable the Ethereum network to process upwards of a million transactions per second.</p>\n<p>Sharding represents a scaling solution that splits blockchain networks into smaller partitions called shards, which contain independent transaction history. In this scenario, individual nodes would only have to process transactions for certain shards, hence allowing the overall transactional throughput to be greater as a single node wouldn’t have to do all the work.</p>\n<p>Plasma, on the other hand, is designated to be a solution for conducting off-chain transactions that does not improve the blockchain itself, instead it takes an existing blockchain and creates a special construction, which is connected to it, and thus provides a much higher throughput. Nevertheless, as it relies on the underlying blockchain of Ethereum, Plasma allows the Ethereum blockchain to continue handling smart contracts and guarantee an advanced layer of security while only broadcasting completed transactions.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the technology, Buterin explained how the two solutions work in complement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If you have a Sharding solution, the Sharding solution itself might increase the scalability of Ethereum by a factor of 100, or eventually even more. But then, if you do Plasma on top of the scalability solution, then what that means is, you’re not just doing 100 times of the amount of activity but you are doing 100 times the amount of entrances, the amount of exits, and despite resolutions.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the recent OmiseGO AMA session hosting Buterin, Sharding and Plasma had already been tested on the Ethereum testnet to support potential decentralized applications (dApps) with millions of users by taking an innovative approach in optimizing the blockchain.</p>\n<p>It is worth to mention that the other day one of the best business conferences, Nordic Business Forum, has nominated Buterin amidst the 25 most promising, successful, and deservedly enviable entrepreneurs under the age of 25 in Northern Europe. The selection criteria adjusts this nomination to a dedicated group of people who is stepping up to challenge the odds and create new solutions that improve lives and create positive change.</p>\n<p>The news especially flatters the supporters of Ethereum who now obtained an addition reason to be proud of. However, at the moment Buterin has made no comments on his nomination.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinspeaker.com/2018/06/04/sharding-plasma-help-ethereum-reach-1m-transactions-per-second-says-vitalik-buterin/">&#8216;Sharding and Plasma to Help Ethereum Reach 1M Transactions per Second,&#8217; Says Vitalik Buterin</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinspeaker.com">CoinSpeaker</a>.</p>',

What this mainstream launch means is Tron&rsquo;s blockchain will no longer be dependent on Ethereum&rsquo;s block.&nbsp;<a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-100k-mainnet-bug-bounty-shows-their-confidence/">TRX</a> was one of the ERC20 digital tokens before, but now it is an independent digital coin existing on its blockchain, marking the beginning of Tron&rsquo;s independence from Ethereum and the decentralization of the web.</p>\n<p>This means TRX tokens which has become a darling to many, will be converted to the MainNet currency in the coming days by a majority of the cryptocurrency exchanges in the market.&nbsp;However, users are required to fulfill a few steps in ensuring the transition takes place. Users have a deadline of June 25 to comply with the new features.</p>\n<p>The May 31 MainNet launch was a unanimous decision to <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-tron-erc20-migration-affect-on-ethereum/">leave Ethereum</a>&rsquo;s in-fighting about community governance as well as &ldquo;high gas tariffs and archaic gas burn mechanism,&rdquo; according to a press release by Tron Foundation.</p>\n<h3>Investors to Wait Longer for Rally</h3>\n<p>However, amidst the excitement and buzz that accompanied the launch of Tron&rsquo;s Odyssey 2.0, there are fears that Tron&rsquo;s prices might further soar following a drop of over 9.7% in the last seven days. Today, Tron&rsquo;s price is at $0.059 while it was at $0.073 on May 26. Additionally, <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-tron-trx-go-as-far-as-3-usd/">TRX</a> is one of the few top 10 virtual currencies that are depreciating in what is an otherwise pool of green.</p>\n<p>Experts are blaming the surge to what they regard as brilliant marketing by the Tron team that managed to heighten expectation, confidence, and awareness of the token.</p>\n<p>But now that the hype is subsiding, Tron needs to actualize real results and meet the high expectation or else it will disappear from the cryptocurrency radar faster than it appeared on it. On the other hand, long-term investors are ignoring the recent shortcomings and are focusing on the long-term prospects.</p>\n<h3>What Next for Tron?</h3>\n<p>Actions that are expected have a positive effect on Tron after launching Odyssey 2.0 include:</p>\n<h4>The Inclusion of More dApps on Tron</h4>\n<p><a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-2018-expected-price-growth/">Tron (TRX)</a> seems to be aligning itself at a vantage point to capture Ethereum&rsquo;s customer base as lack of scalability and transaction costs continue to trouble the investor of smart contracts.</p>\n<p>Odyssey 2.0, Tron&rsquo;s new main net, increases the overall throughput of the platform to over 1000 TPS while charging little or no cost for transactions.</p>\n<p>If you compare the two, you will see that Tron solves Ethereum&rsquo;s &lt;25TPS issue and high transaction rate challenge by offering a better platform to build and develop decentralized applications.</p>\n<h4>Trading Volumes to Increase</h4>\n<p>Even though daily <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/go-for-tron-trx-or-lose-otherwise/">TRX</a> volumes being traded are yet to match the highs of the over $3.8 billion worth of Tron that were traded on a single day early this year, the current volume of about $700 million is predicted to pass the billion-dollar mark as the new Main Net settles down.</p>\n<h4>Election of Super Representatives</h4>\n<p>Super Representatives are argued to play a role in stabilizing and improving the value of <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-bullish-trend-can-it-keep-going-up/">TRX</a> by representing the will of contributors to the project and providing the much-awaited governance of the project.</p>\n<p>All in all, not just the above-mentioned factors will bring in&nbsp;<a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-holders-will-taste-success-soon/">Tron&rsquo;s rally shortly</a>, the project has put together a number of things in a &lsquo;right&rsquo; way &ndash; so it will only go up. The enormous investment Tron has received cannot make it die easily. Prices are expected to appreciate within the month with an all-time high expected to take place at the end of June.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The ideologically driven crowd started to organize through a mailing list centred around privacy-enhancing technologies. Like Dwork and Naor, these “Cypherpunks” — as they would come to be called — utilized the relatively new science of cryptography to work toward their goals.</p><p>Over the years, Adam Back — who earned his Ph.D. in 1996 — established himself as one of the more active participants on this list, at times contributing dozens of emails in a single month. Like most Cypherpunks, the cryptographer was passionate about topics including<a href="http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1997/03/msg00586.html"> privacy</a>,<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/09/msg00407.html"> free speech</a> and<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/09/msg01919.html"> libertarianism</a>, and engaged in technical discussions pertaining<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/07/msg00851.html"> to anonymous remailers</a>,<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/07/msg00836.html"> encrypted file systems</a>,<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/09/msg01919.html"> electronic cash</a> as<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/genesis-files-how-david-chaums-ecash-spawned-cypherpunk-dream/"> introduced</a> by Dr. David Chaum, and more.</p><p>But for a while, Back was perhaps best known for printing and selling “munition” shirts: T-shirts with an encryption protocol printed on them, intended to help point out the absurd decision by the U.S. government to regulate Phil Zimmermann’s PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption program as “munitions” within the definition of the U.S. export regulations. Wearing Back’s shirt while crossing the border to exit the United States technically made you a “munitions exporter.”</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/munitions_tshirt.original.jpg" width="990" height="550" alt="munitions tshirt"><br/></p><p>Like many, Back was <a href="http://datwww.mit.edu/bloom-picayune/crypto/2058">not aware</a> of Dwork and Naor’s proof-of-work proposal. But by the mid-1990s, he was thinking of similar ideas to counter spam, sometimes “out loud” on the Cypherpunks mailing list.</p><p>“A side benefit of using PGP, is that PGP encryption should add some overhead to the spammer — he can probably encrypt less messages per second than he can spam down a T3 link,” Back<a data-original-title="" href="http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1997/03/msg00631.html"> commented</a>, for example, in the context of adding more privacy to remailers; an idea somewhat similar to Dwork and Naor’s.</p><p>The Cypherpunks mailing list grew significantly in about half a decade. What started out as an online discussion platform for a group of people that initially gathered at one of their startups in the Bay Area became a small internet phenomenon with thousands of subscribers — and often more emails on a single day than anyone could reasonably keep track of.</p><p>It was around this time — 1997, close to the list’s peak popularity — that Back submitted his Hashcash proposal.</p><h4>Hashcash</h4><p>Hashcah is similar to Dwork and Naor’s anti-spam proposal and has the same purpose, though Back proposed some additional use cases like countering anonymous remailer abuse. But as the name suggests, Hashcash was not based on cryptographic puzzles like Dwork and Naor’s; it was based on hashing.</p><p>Hashing is a cryptographic trick that takes any data — whether it’s a single letter or an entire book — and turns it into a seemingly random number of predetermined length.</p>For example, a SHA-256 hash of the sentence <i>This is a sentence</i> produces this hexadecimal number:<p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_9.06.43_AM.original.png" width="1250" height="48" alt="hash1"><br/></p><p></p><p>Which can be “translated” to the regular decimal number:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_8.55.03_AM.original.png" width="1340" height="102" alt="hash2"><br/></p><p></p><p>Or to binary:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_8.55.16_AM.original.png" width="1296" height="182" alt="hash binary"><br/></p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a SHA-256 hash of the sentence <i>This, is a sentence</i> produces this hexadecimal number:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_9.08.15_AM.original.png" width="1252" height="48" alt="hash3"><br/></p><p></p><p>As you can see, merely inserting one comma into the sentence completely changes the hash. And, importantly, what the hash of either sentence would be was completely unpredictable; even after the first sentence was hashed, there was no way to calculate the second hash from it. The only way to find out was to actually hash both sentences.</p><p>Hashcash applies this mathematical trick in a clever way.</p><p>With Hashcash, the metadata of an email (the “from” address, the “to” address, the time, etc.) is formalized as a protocol. Additionally, the sender of an email must add a random number to this metadata: a “nonce.” All this metadata, including the nonce, is then hashed, so the resulting hash looks a bit like one of the random numbers above.</p><p>Here’s the trick: not every hash is considered “valid.” Instead, the binary version of the hash must start with a predetermined number of zeroes. For example: 20 zeroes. The sender can generate a hash that starts with 20 zeroes by including a nonce that randomly adds up correctly … but the sender can’t know in advance what that nonce will look like.</p><p>To generate a valid hash, therefore, the sender has only one option: trial and error (“brute force”). He must keep trying different nonces until he finds a valid combination; otherwise, his email will be rejected by the intended recipient’s email client. Like Dwork and Naor’s solution, this requires computational resources: it’s a proof-of-work system.</p><p>“[I]f it hasn’t got a 20 bit hash […] you have a program which bounces it with a notice explaining the required postage, and where to obtain software from,” Back explained on the Cypherpunks mailing list. “This would put spammers out of business overnight, as 1,000,000 x 20 = 100 MIP years which is going to be more compute than they\'ve got.”</p><p>Notably, Back’s proof-of-work system is more random than Dwork and Naor’s. The duo’s solution required solving a puzzle, meaning that a faster computer would solve it faster than a slow computer every time. But statistically, Hashcash would still allow for the slower computer to find a correct solution faster some of the time.</p><p>(By analogy, if one person runs faster than another person, the former will win a sprint between them every time. But if one person buys more lottery tickets than another person, the latter will statistically still win some of the time — just not as often.)</p><h4>Digital Scarcity</h4><p>Like Dwork and Naor’s proposal, Hashcash — which Back would elaborate on in a<a href="http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf"> white paper</a> in 2002 — never took off in a very big way. It was implemented in Apache’s open-source SpamAssassin platform, and Microsoft gave the proof-of-work idea a spin in the incompatible “email postmark” format. And Back, as well as other academics, came up with various alternative applications for the solution over the years, but most of these never gained much traction. For most potential applications, the lack of any network effect was probably too big to overcome.</p><p>Nevertheless, Dwork and Naor as well as Back (independently) did introduce something new. Where one of the most powerful features of digital products is the ease with which they can be copied, proof of work was essentially the first concept akin to virtual scarcity that didn’t rely on a central party: it tied digital data to the real-world, limited resource of computing power.</p><p>And scarcity, of course, is a prerequisite for money. Indeed, Back in particular explicitly placed Hashcash in the category of money throughout his Cypherpunks mailing list contributions and white paper, mirroring it to the only digital cash the world had seen at that point in time: DigiCash’s Ecash by Chaum.</p><p>“Hashcash may provide a stop gap measure until digicash becomes more widely used,” Back argued on the mailing list. “Hashcash is free, all you’ve got to do is burn some cycles on your PC. It is in keeping with net culture of free discourse, where the financially challenged can duke it out with millionaires, retired government officials, etc on equal terms. [And] Hashcash may provide us with a fall back method for controling [sic] spam if digicash goes sour (gets outlawed or required to escrow user identities).”</p><p>Despite the name, however, Hashcash couldn’t properly function as a full-fledged cash in itself (nor could Dwork and Naor’s proposal). Perhaps most importantly, any “received” proof of work is useless to the recipient. Unlike money, it could not be re-spent elsewhere. On top of that, as computers increased in speed every year, they could produce more and more proofs over time at lower cost: Hashcash would have been subject to (hyper)inflation.</p><p>What proof of work did offer, more than anything else, was a new basis for research in the digital-money realm. Several of the most notable digital-money proposals that followed were building on Hashcash, typically by allowing the proofs of work to be reused. (With Hal Finney’s Reusable Proof of Work — RPOW — as the most obvious example.)</p><h4>Bitcoin</h4><p>Ultimately, of course, proof of work became a cornerstone for Bitcoin, with Hashcash as one of the few citations in the Bitcoin white paper.</p><p>Yet, in Bitcoin, Hashcash (or, rather, a version of it) is utilized very differently than many would have guessed beforehand. Unlike Hashcash and other Hashcash-based proposals, the scarcity it provides is not itself used as money at all. Instead, Hashcash enables a race. Whichever miner is the first to produce a valid proof of work — a hash of a Bitcoin block — gets to decide which transactions go through. At least in theory, anyone can compete equally: much like a lottery, even small miners would statistically be the first to produce a valid proof of work every so often.</p><p>Further, once a new block is mined, confirming a set of transactions, these transactions are unlikely to be reversed. An attacker would have to prove at least as much work as required to find the block in the first place, and under normal circumstances exponentially more, for any additional block. The real-world resources that must be spent in order to cheat outweigh the potential profit that can be made by cheating, which should give recipients of Bitcoin transactions confidence that these transactions are final.</p><p>This is how, in Bitcoin, Hashcash killed two birds with one stone. It solved the <a data-original-title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spending problem</a> in a decentralized way, while providing a trick to get new coins into circulation with no centralized issuer.</p><p>Hashcash did not realize the first electronic cash system — Ecash takes that crown, and proof-of-work could not really function as money. But a <i>decentralized</i> electronic cash system might well have been impossible without Back’s proof of work.</p><p><i>For more on the history of proof of work, also see<a data-original-title="" href="http://hashcash.org"> hashcash.org</a> and, in particular,<a data-original-title="" href="http://hashcash.org/papers/"> hashcash.org/papers/</a>.</i></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>\n\n          \n\n          <p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com">Bitcoin Magazine</a>.</em></p>',

Wearing Back’s shirt while crossing the border to exit the United States technically made you a “munitions exporter.”</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/munitions_tshirt.original.jpg" width="990" height="550" alt="munitions tshirt"><br/></p><p>Like many, Back was <a href="http://datwww.mit.edu/bloom-picayune/crypto/2058">not aware</a> of Dwork and Naor’s proof-of-work proposal. But by the mid-1990s, he was thinking of similar ideas to counter spam, sometimes “out loud” on the Cypherpunks mailing list.</p><p>“A side benefit of using PGP, is that PGP encryption should add some overhead to the spammer — he can probably encrypt less messages per second than he can spam down a T3 link,” Back<a data-original-title="" href="http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1997/03/msg00631.html"> commented</a>, for example, in the context of adding more privacy to remailers; an idea somewhat similar to Dwork and Naor’s.</p><p>The Cypherpunks mailing list grew significantly in about half a decade. What started out as an online discussion platform for a group of people that initially gathered at one of their startups in the Bay Area became a small internet phenomenon with thousands of subscribers — and often more emails on a single day than anyone could reasonably keep track of.</p><p>It was around this time — 1997, close to the list’s peak popularity — that Back submitted his Hashcash proposal.</p><h4>Hashcash</h4><p>Hashcah is similar to Dwork and Naor’s anti-spam proposal and has the same purpose, though Back proposed some additional use cases like countering anonymous remailer abuse. But as the name suggests, Hashcash was not based on cryptographic puzzles like Dwork and Naor’s; it was based on hashing.</p><p>Hashing is a cryptographic trick that takes any data — whether it’s a single letter or an entire book — and turns it into a seemingly random number of predetermined length.</p>For example, a SHA-256 hash of the sentence <i>This is a sentence</i> produces this hexadecimal number:<p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_9.06.43_AM.original.png" width="1250" height="48" alt="hash1"><br/></p><p></p><p>Which can be “translated” to the regular decimal number:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_8.55.03_AM.original.png" width="1340" height="102" alt="hash2"><br/></p><p></p><p>Or to binary:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_8.55.16_AM.original.png" width="1296" height="182" alt="hash binary"><br/></p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a SHA-256 hash of the sentence <i>This, is a sentence</i> produces this hexadecimal number:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_9.08.15_AM.original.png" width="1252" height="48" alt="hash3"><br/></p><p></p><p>As you can see, merely inserting one comma into the sentence completely changes the hash. And, importantly, what the hash of either sentence would be was completely unpredictable; even after the first sentence was hashed, there was no way to calculate the second hash from it. The only way to find out was to actually hash both sentences.</p><p>Hashcash applies this mathematical trick in a clever way.</p><p>With Hashcash, the metadata of an email (the “from” address, the “to” address, the time, etc.) is formalized as a protocol. Additionally, the sender of an email must add a random number to this metadata: a “nonce.” All this metadata, including the nonce, is then hashed, so the resulting hash looks a bit like one of the random numbers above.</p><p>Here’s the trick: not every hash is considered “valid.” Instead, the binary version of the hash must start with a predetermined number of zeroes. For example: 20 zeroes. The sender can generate a hash that starts with 20 zeroes by including a nonce that randomly adds up correctly … but the sender can’t know in advance what that nonce will look like.</p><p>To generate a valid hash, therefore, the sender has only one option: trial and error (“brute force”). He must keep trying different nonces until he finds a valid combination; otherwise, his email will be rejected by the intended recipient’s email client. Like Dwork and Naor’s solution, this requires computational resources: it’s a proof-of-work system.</p><p>“[I]f it hasn’t got a 20 bit hash […] you have a program which bounces it with a notice explaining the required postage, and where to obtain software from,” Back explained on the Cypherpunks mailing list. “This would put spammers out of business overnight, as 1,000,000 x 20 = 100 MIP years which is going to be more compute than they\'ve got.”</p><p>Notably, Back’s proof-of-work system is more random than Dwork and Naor’s. The duo’s solution required solving a puzzle, meaning that a faster computer would solve it faster than a slow computer every time. But statistically, Hashcash would still allow for the slower computer to find a correct solution faster some of the time.</p><p>(By analogy, if one person runs faster than another person, the former will win a sprint between them every time. But if one person buys more lottery tickets than another person, the latter will statistically still win some of the time — just not as often.)</p><h4>Digital Scarcity</h4><p>Like Dwork and Naor’s proposal, Hashcash — which Back would elaborate on in a<a href="http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf"> white paper</a> in 2002 — never took off in a very big way. It was implemented in Apache’s open-source SpamAssassin platform, and Microsoft gave the proof-of-work idea a spin in the incompatible “email postmark” format. And Back, as well as other academics, came up with various alternative applications for the solution over the years, but most of these never gained much traction. For most potential applications, the lack of any network effect was probably too big to overcome.</p><p>Nevertheless, Dwork and Naor as well as Back (independently) did introduce something new. Where one of the most powerful features of digital products is the ease with which they can be copied, proof of work was essentially the first concept akin to virtual scarcity that didn’t rely on a central party: it tied digital data to the real-world, limited resource of computing power.</p><p>And scarcity, of course, is a prerequisite for money. Indeed, Back in particular explicitly placed Hashcash in the category of money throughout his Cypherpunks mailing list contributions and white paper, mirroring it to the only digital cash the world had seen at that point in time: DigiCash’s Ecash by Chaum.</p><p>“Hashcash may provide a stop gap measure until digicash becomes more widely used,” Back argued on the mailing list. “Hashcash is free, all you’ve got to do is burn some cycles on your PC. It is in keeping with net culture of free discourse, where the financially challenged can duke it out with millionaires, retired government officials, etc on equal terms. [And] Hashcash may provide us with a fall back method for controling [sic] spam if digicash goes sour (gets outlawed or required to escrow user identities).”</p><p>Despite the name, however, Hashcash couldn’t properly function as a full-fledged cash in itself (nor could Dwork and Naor’s proposal). Perhaps most importantly, any “received” proof of work is useless to the recipient. Unlike money, it could not be re-spent elsewhere. On top of that, as computers increased in speed every year, they could produce more and more proofs over time at lower cost: Hashcash would have been subject to (hyper)inflation.</p><p>What proof of work did offer, more than anything else, was a new basis for research in the digital-money realm. Several of the most notable digital-money proposals that followed were building on Hashcash, typically by allowing the proofs of work to be reused. (With Hal Finney’s Reusable Proof of Work — RPOW — as the most obvious example.)</p><h4>Bitcoin</h4><p>Ultimately, of course, proof of work became a cornerstone for Bitcoin, with Hashcash as one of the few citations in the Bitcoin white paper.</p><p>Yet, in Bitcoin, Hashcash (or, rather, a version of it) is utilized very differently than many would have guessed beforehand. Unlike Hashcash and other Hashcash-based proposals, the scarcity it provides is not itself used as money at all. Instead, Hashcash enables a race. Whichever miner is the first to produce a valid proof of work — a hash of a Bitcoin block — gets to decide which transactions go through. At least in theory, anyone can compete equally: much like a lottery, even small miners would statistically be the first to produce a valid proof of work every so often.</p><p>Further, once a new block is mined, confirming a set of transactions, these transactions are unlikely to be reversed. An attacker would have to prove at least as much work as required to find the block in the first place, and under normal circumstances exponentially more, for any additional block. The real-world resources that must be spent in order to cheat outweigh the potential profit that can be made by cheating, which should give recipients of Bitcoin transactions confidence that these transactions are final.</p><p>This is how, in Bitcoin, Hashcash killed two birds with one stone. It solved the <a data-original-title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spending problem</a> in a decentralized way, while providing a trick to get new coins into circulation with no centralized issuer.</p><p>Hashcash did not realize the first electronic cash system — Ecash takes that crown, and proof-of-work could not really function as money. But a <i>decentralized</i> electronic cash system might well have been impossible without Back’s proof of work.</p><p><i>For more on the history of proof of work, also see<a data-original-title="" href="http://hashcash.org"> hashcash.org</a> and, in particular,<a data-original-title="" href="http://hashcash.org/papers/"> hashcash.org/papers/</a>.</i></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>\n\n          \n\n           <p><em>This  article originally appeared on <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com">Bitcoin Magazine</a>.</em></p>',

        content: '<span class="entry-content"><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Japan has quickly become an important region in the cryptocurrency industry. It is one of the few countries to effectively legitimize Bitcoin as a means, yet the region is also home to strict regulation. As such, HitBTC has confirmed it will suspend services in Japan to avoid any friction with local regulators.</span></p>\n<h2><b>HitBTC Suspends Service in Japan</b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the past few years, </span><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2017/12/22/hitbtc-users-cannot-move-withdraw-usdt-due-currency-operations-not-available-error/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">HitBTC </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">has become a very popular cryptocurrency trading platform. The company offers many different cryptocurrency pairs. Their presence also spans many countries around the world, including Japan. Unfortunately, it appears that latter aspect will come to change fairly soon. Due to looming friction with local authorities, HitBTC will <a href="https://blog.hitbtc.com/hitbtc-is-preparing-to-launch-a-regulated-subsidiary-in-japan/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">suspend</a> its service in the region.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most people know exchanges operating in Japan need to obtain authorization from regulators. That process also involves obtaining a specific </span><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/30/japans-fsa-is-pressuring-exchanges-to-drop-cryptocurrencies-favoured-by-criminals/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">license</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. As of right now, HitBTC does not have such a license. Nor do they plan to obtain one, by the look of things. The logical outcome is to suspend the services provided in the country until further notice.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyone visiting the site with a Japanese IP address will need to provide residency details. If they can prove they do not reside in Japan, accessing the platform will remain possible. Otherwise, they will have to look for a different trading platform supporting cryptocurrencies.  There is no shortage of such companies in Japan, though.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Other Exchanges to Follow?</b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Domestic exchanges in Japan usually go through the licensing process without problems. Over a dozen companies are licensed, with a handful more to be granted a license in the weeks to come. For foreign companies such as HitBTC, the situation is a bit different. There&#8217;s also the fact the company offers Monero trading, which has become a topic of </span><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/04/japanese-fsa-discriminating-anonymous-cryptocurrencies-shows-why-decentralized-exchanges-are-needed/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">debate </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">among Japanese regulators. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not the first bigger trading platform to leave Japan either. Kraken, one of the world&#8217;s bigger exchanges, took the same steps in April of 2018. According to officials, Kraken made this choice based on &#8220;rising costs&#8221; rather than licensing issues. Even so, it shows foreign trading platforms will have some tough decisions to make moving forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Binance has also been warned about its lack of an official license. Whether or not they will pursue this regulatory requirement, remains a bit unclear as of right now. HitBTC is in the process of making a return to Japan in the future, though. For now, the company is working with a Japanese law firm to go through the licensing process.  It remains unclear how long that process may take.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<pre>Image from Shutterstock</pre>\n</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/04/hitbtc-temporarily-suspends-services-japan-licensing-process/" data-wpel-link="internal">HitBTC Temporarily Suspends Services in Japan During Licensing Process</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com" data-wpel-link="internal">NewsBTC</a>.</p>',

In fact I would strongly disagree with that&hellip; [what&rsquo;s more], cryptocurrencies can be traced, unlike fiat currencies [cash].&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As CT&rsquo;s correspondent noted, the notion that transactions involving crypto are in fact more traceable than fiat currencies can seem counterintuitive, given that achieving <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-anonymous-is-the-purchase-of-crypto-regulations-practice-risks">anonymity</a> was one of the motivating impulses behind the invention of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<p>Buchanan, however, stressed that there are now many &ldquo;commercially available&rdquo; tools that law enforcement can leverage to trace how currency has moved on a blockchain. She mentioned blockchain-specific intelligence systems such as <a  href="https://www.elliptic.co" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Elliptic</a> and <a  href="https://www.chainalysis.com" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chainalysis</a> as prominent examples.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, Buchanan admitted that law enforcement &ldquo;has a lot of catching up to do,&rdquo; likening the challenge to the early days of the internet. She suggested that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-cftc-irs-and-others-a-guide-to-us-regulating-bodies">regulators</a>, too, will need to &ldquo;update&rdquo; their practices in order to &ldquo;keep pace,&rdquo; as the outdated <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/bytom-passed-the-sec-howey-test-becomes-the-first-non-securities-public-blockchain-project-in-the-usa">legislation</a> introduced in the early 20th century for traditional securities is proving itself an awkward fit for 21st century innovations.</p>\n\n<p>Buchanan is currently serving as a General Counsel to major <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency-exchange">crypto exchange</a> <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/kraken">Kraken</a>, and says she has been &ldquo;very involved&rdquo; in the crypto industry for the past four to five years. She advocated cryptocurrencies as a &ldquo;wonderful tool&rdquo; that provides a &ldquo;cost-effective&rdquo; means for the transfer of value globally. When asked about the future of crypto <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/adoption">adoption</a>, Buchanan considered that we&rsquo;re &ldquo;already&rdquo; seeing it &ldquo;around the world,&rdquo; suggesting its increasing use by <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-blockchain-is-banking-the-unbanked">unbanked</a> populations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As a recent Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-vs-cash-how-the-numbers-stack-up-on-drugs-guns-murders">report</a> showed, cryptocurrencies are indisputably exploited for illicit ends, with an early 2018 paper estimating that &ldquo;approximately one-quarter of all users... and close to one-half of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> transactions...are associated with illegal activity.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>However, these findings, when placed within a broader context, fall into a more nuanced light. Whereas global illicit Bitcoin activity annually is estimated at a value of around $72 bln, the same paper cites figures for 2010 that reveal that $100 bln in fiat was spent on drugs in the US alone.</p>\n</p>',

There are many reasons why investors should consider NEO, which has a very large untapped potential. Let&rsquo;s explore some of them, so that you might get a better view of its situation.</p>\n<h3>About NEO</h3>\n<p>NEO originally came to be under the name of Antshares. Saying that it is a lesser crypto might not be doing it justice, since it is still among the top 15, with the rank of 11 according to the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/">CoinMarketCap</a>. Just like other cryptos, NEO has experienced both a large rise and a though fall when the market value of cryptos dropped at the beginning of 2018. Its current price is $54.50, which is not bad, considering that there are a lot of other digital currencies that have suffered more or even completely disappeared due to their losses.</p>\n<p>Despite all that has happened, NEO still has a very large potential to become the next king of cryptos, and it might even happen during this very year. It might seem unlikely at first, which is why we will now explore a few reasons that might confirm this, at least as a valid possibility.</p>\n<h3>NEO&rsquo;s ICO plan</h3>\n<p>NEO has had a very large success when it comes to <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/the-7-golden-icos-to-shine-in-q2-of-2018/">ICOs</a> so far. It managed to reach 800% of its growth, and it has proven to be one of the best ways for large companies to get funds for their businesses. It scheduled a number of them in the days to come, and it already held a lot of successful ones in the past. Despite the general mistrust of ICOs around the world, in NEO&rsquo;s case, this will be one of the biggest forces that will help it achieve greatness.</p>\n<h3>Smart handling of Smart Contracts</h3>\n<p>NEO is, of course, a cryptocurrency, but that is not all it is. Some would argue that it is, first and foremost, a platform. As a platform, it had a lot of success as well, and it has proven to be safe and trustworthy. It can offer a secure and stable blockchain, which allows for the creation of dApps and smart contracts.</p>\n<p>More and more people are beginning to realize that smart contracts are one of the most important aspects of these new technologies, and NEO is right there with <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ethereum-eth-price-dips-eos-eos-event-responsible-for-the-drop/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> in this regard. Smart contracts and blockchain tech, in general, hold a lot of potentials, not just for cryptos, but for various businesses, as well as for solving many really big problems in the world.</p>\n<h3>It doesn&rsquo;t have a strong presence in exchanges</h3>\n<p>This one might be a bit controversial, and many are wondering how can this be a good thing? Well, it is, since NEO&rsquo;s whole thing is relying on revenue received from blockchain investments. Sure, the trading value would be a nice bonus, but it is not NEO&rsquo;s primary goal. Since it is not that popular with exchanges, it can rely on honest partnerships with those who seek its stability and growth over time. A lot of cryptos have a problem with bullish investors who simply seek to make a profit as quickly as possible, and sometimes, this works out. Most of the time, however, the crypto gets a large but false sense of support, which could lead to ruin.</p>\n<h3>Community and support</h3>\n<p>Over time, NEO has managed to develop quite a large community, especially during the crypto hype of 2017. Just like other cryptos, NEO has grown as a project at this time, which has caught the attention of a lot of people. If you are familiar with cryptos at all, you certainly know that having a community that will support a crypto and spread the awareness can be crucial in the times of trouble, especially for smaller coins.</p>\n<p>Another very important thing is the fact that NEO is supported by China and its government. This has even gone as far as for NEO to be called Chinese Ethereum. This does not mean that its focus is solely on the Chinese market, however, and NEO makes quite an effort to expand and provide its services to anyone and everyone willing to accept them. Still, support from such a large force can&rsquo;t hurt.</p>\n<p>China became infamous in the world of cryptos after it started banning exchanges, crypto trade, and a lot of things related to cryptos in general. Still, it seems to have a soft spot for NEO, and it certainly won&rsquo;t miss an opportunity to join and explore technology with such large potential. Right now, China is still trying to figure out a way to regulate cryptos and ICOs, which is a good thing. An even better thing is that it has always worked well with NEO, which might end up being this entire country&rsquo;s crypto of choice some day.</p>\n<p>All in all, NEO is a crypto on the rise, with its efforts being focused on many different aspects of the crypto world. It might not be as popular as Bitcoin, <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/why-nano-nano-is-a-safer-bet-than-litecoin-ltc/">Litecoin</a>, or even <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-tron-trx-live-up-to-the-hype-despite-crashing-during-the-mainnet-launch/">TRON</a> (especially these days), but the market is still young, and very, very far from being fully developed. Some time is necessary for the truly capable cryptos to reach their full potential and rise from the large sea of various currencies. Still, that time will come, and when it does, you&rsquo;d want to be caught supporting the ones that can go far, which is definitely a category NEO belongs in.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

        content: '<div class="optinengine_before_post"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IOTA’s much anticipated Qubic finally made its appearance as the team revealed a few of its details for the IOTA community and its investors. However, unlike last time, IOTA coin bulls didn&#8217;t make an appearance, rather MIOTA declined by 11 percent amidst the red market. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Qubic: Messaging and payment system</b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, IOTA revealed its much anticipated <strong>Qubic protocol</strong>. After weeks of speculation, what was touted as the most important development in the history of the IOTA made its way to the public. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the official website, <a href="https://coingape.com/iota-tedx-talk-attract-new-partners-mergers/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qubic </a>is described as </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“a protocol that specifies IOTA&#8217;s solution for oracle machines, smart contracts, outsourced computations, and more.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team didn&#8217;t go all out with the details, but the IOTA community and investors did get to know more about the project. However, the developments for the same are still being worked on. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The official tweet from IOTA read: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Qubic platform will be the most significant contribution to the IOTA stack, it will enable unlimited new use cases and turn the IOTA Project into a full solution. Information and details are beginning to be unveiled right now at http://qubic.iota.org </span>#IOTA #Qubic.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further clearing the air around it being an individual currency on its own, IOTA states: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Qubic is not a new token or coin; there will be no Qubic ICO or airdrop.” </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qubic is basically an application that is to improve the existing IOTA model. To be exact, </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the most apparent change is that there now exists a working protocol to serve as the messaging and payment system: IOTA.”</span></em></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about the original Qubic idea which had several severe issues, now Qubic is following the IOTA standards for “IoT messaging and payments”. Through “fee-free IOTA transactions”, this has been made possible.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Also, read: <a title="VeChain Collaborates with Private Firms to Make VeChainThor Blockchain Rock Solid" href="https://coingape.com/vechain-make-vechainthor-blockchain-solid/?utm_source=read_more&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="bookmark">VeChain Collaborates with Private Firms to Make VeChainThor Blockchain Rock Solid</a></strong></span></em></p>\n<h3><b>IOTA coin bears take over bulls</b></h3>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The much awaited and anticipated announcement of Qubic was expected to pump IOTA price, however, what happened was actually the opposite. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last time, the IOTA coin Foundation gave a sneak peak of Qubic, <a href="https://coingape.com/iota-price-high-with-trinity-wallet-release/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIOTA </a>price took a huge jump, unlike, this time. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the fact is <a href="https://coingape.com/gibraltar-blockchain-exchange-launch/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> doesn’t work according to the usual and expected sentiments. Moreover, the majority of the market is currently experiencing the red. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IOTA is at $1.74 with a drop down of about 11 percent in the past 24-hours. At the 9th position, IOTA’s market cap is about $4.8 billion. Moreover, the scope of the Qubic has been extended with its development underway.  It can be expected that once the greens enter the market, IOTA coin will see a nice rise in the wake of its latest developments and announcements. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Do you think IOTA developments will increase its market value?

Making a wrong move would mean losing money, which is not an option for any crypto investor. When it comes to <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/why-you-should-buy-cardano-ada-right-now/">Cardano (ADA)</a> and <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/neo-fails-to-complete-bullish-pennant-pattern/">NEO</a>, making the decision gets even more difficult since both coins have their strong sides. The ultimate coin does not exist as of yet, which means that those willing to invest in cryptos simply have to make due with what is on the table.</p>\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s take a look at Cardano and NEO, and try to determine what can each of these coins offer, so that you can decide for yourself which one is worthy of your time.</p>\n<h2>NEO vs Cardano</h2>\n<h3>About NEO</h3>\n<p>We will start by taking a look at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/">NEO </a>first. Originally, it was called Antshares, and it was launched in 2014, in China. Because of the way it was built, it was called Ethereum of China, since it tries to provide its users with a specific set of functionalities. It has not received much attention in the West until recently, and many people have barely even heard of it. However, NEO is pretty big in the East.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, it is pretty similar to Ethereum, and its goal is to digitize the economic system on the global level. It plans to do so by providing a strongly-decentralized infrastructure for pushing smart contracts, which is also explained in its whitepaper.</p>\n<p>Now, smart contracts have been around for a while now, and Ethereum&rsquo;s platform has mostly been seen as their strongest proponent. Basically, they are a piece of code which has a purpose to determine if a transaction is legitimate, and whether or not it should be completed.</p>\n<p>Its founders are core developer Zhang Zhengwen and Da Hongfei, but it is also backed by <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/waltonchain-wtc-winning-awards-and-partnerships/">OnChain</a>, which is a firm set up by its founders in order to make sure that everything will work as it should. The founders are, to this day, very supportive of NEO, and are often visiting various meetups, events, and alike.</p>\n<p>So, what is it that makes NEO so great? Well, not its technology or features that it can offer. To clarify &ndash; we are not saying that any of it is bad or that it doesn&rsquo;t work. However, the fact is that NEO simply doesn&rsquo;t have anything revolutionary. Its biggest strength is the fact that is accepted by China, which has become infamous as a country where cryptos don&rsquo;t receive much love. NEO has managed to grow in a country like that, which is almost a unique feature these days, and that is where its main power lies.</p>\n<h3>About Cardano (ADA)</h3>\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/">Cardano</a>. It started its operations back in 2015, almost at the very end of the year. This timing, as well as its technology, are making it fall under the third wave of cryptos. Its developers have decided to make a crypto that will use the knowledge of its predecessors, which is why ADA is a mix of various design principles. Their goal was to make a crypto that will be capable to overcome regular obstacles that have still turned out to be lethal to many currencies. Eventually, their goal for ADA was to make it strong enough to rival even BTC itself.</p>\n<p>It was developed by Ethereum&rsquo;s co-founder and ex-CEO, Charles Hoskinson, and its main goal is to provide smart contracts that would rely on its own ADA coins. For a long time, this coin has been concentrating on developing and improving its own technology, so that its services would become flawless. Its team is yet another of ADA&rsquo;s advantages since it is made up of academics, professors, and other kinds of professionals who really know what they are doing. This is one of the most important parts of the crypto since its future cannot exist without the right people backing it up.</p>\n<p>And, while we are talking about Cardano supporters, there are several of them, but three major organizations are among the strongest ones. Those are The Cardano foundation, IOHK, and Emurgo. Each of them has contributed to this coin in its own way. The Cardano Foundation has promoted it and help create its community, as well as teach the members about cryptos. IOHK is responsible for ADA&rsquo;s technology, while Emurgo is the entity responsible for the integration of Cardano&rsquo;s platform into various businesses.</p>\n<p>So, what is it that makes Cardano special?</p>\n<p>Right now, the answer is &ndash; its protocols and features. Cardano has some pretty unique aspects, which include Proof-of-Stake protocol. layered tech, the use of two wallets, coding language, governance model, and alike.</p>\n<p>Even with all of this, Cardano has yet to develop, and it has a lot of potentials to become even stronger, bigger, and more powerful than it is right now. Its team knows what it is doing, its community is thriving, and more and more people are beginning to see its potential.</p>\n<h3>Which one is better?</h3>\n<p>It is hard to answer this question since both of these cryptos have their own strengths and weaknesses. They both seem to compete with Ethereum to some extent, but neither of them is good enough to surpass it at this point. In the future &ndash; perhaps, but not right now. In the end, nobody can know what will happen in a few years, and which of these coins will come up on top.</p>\n<p>The only thing that we can be certain of is that they are not wasting their potential, and both of them are doing as best as they can to develop their strengths and provide the best service.

Well, Justin Sun and the <a href="https://tron.network/index?lng=en">Tron (TRX)</a> Foundation are offering a bug bounty reward of up to $10 Million for anyone who will find technical vulnerabilities in the TRON MainNet.</p>\n<h4>But first, let us define ethical hacking.</h4>\n<p><a href="http://wiki.cas.mcmaster.ca/index.php/Ethical_Hacking"><b>Ethical Hacking</b></a>, also known as&nbsp;penetration testing,&nbsp;intrusion testing, or&nbsp;red teaming, is the controversial act of locating weaknesses and vulnerabilities of computer and information systems by duplicating the intent and actions of malicious&nbsp;hackers.</p>\n<p>It is with this background that Justin Sun made the announcement of the $10 Million bug bounty via twitter when he said <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1002543756078223361">the following</a>:</p>\n<p><em><strong>&ldquo;TRON Bug Bounty Program with a highest reward of USD$10 million. We take the security of <s>#</s>TRON mainnet very seriously. If you have made an important discovery of potential bugs, please contact us and join the TRON Bug Bounty Program&rdquo;</strong></em></p>\n<p>The TRON MainNet, also known as Odyssey v2.0, is currently available <a href="https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/releases">on GitHub</a> for download and testing.</p>\n<p>Refreshing our memories on recent vulnerabilities discovered in both the Ethereum and EOS platforms, one can understand why the reward has been set so high. Standard blockchain platforms include sensitive user data along with the transaction records that can be manipulated by a rogue hacker. One needs only refer to the recent Verge (XVG) hacks that have left users and fans of the entire crypto-verse shaken.</p>\n<p>In the case of EOS&rsquo; MainNet, the platform was recently found <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-eos-will-weather-the-storm-of-vulnerabilities-and-come-out-stronger/">to contain security vulnerabilities</a> to the level of causing a possible full-blown cyber attack, all a rogue hackers had to do, was to create a smart contract that took control of all the nodes on the platform. The nodes would, in turn, be used to mine other cryptocurrency networks and cause the full cyber attack earlier mentioned.</p>\n<p>Justin Sun and the Tron Foundation have done the right thing by initiation a bug bounty program to guarantee the platform is secure before token migration starts on the 21st of June and the Genesis block is launched on the 25th of the same month.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The OpenPayFX comes at a time when bank customers live a busy lifestyle and want banking options on the go rather than queuing at a bank or ATM. OpenPayFX does just that and leads the way in terms of fintech solutions on the blockchain.

As the Ripple solutions continue being adopted by banks and financial institutions, it might be safe to conclude that XRP might eventually become <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/does-ripple-xrp-have-a-shot-at-becoming-a-global-reserve-currency/">the global reserve currency</a> for central banks.</p>\n<p>Current market analysis indicates XRP is still trying to get a footing in this volatile times of crypto trading. The coin is currently trading at $0.612 at the moment of writing this and down less than a percentage point in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) still continues to dominate the market at its current price of $7,420.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

On June 1, 2018, Pedro Moreno-Sanchez appeared in a Cypherpunks 101 <a title="" href="https://youtu.be/dGpoXxAiBuI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> where shared his ideas and journey into the world of securing bitcoin and its blockchain. He believes that the <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/tag/cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a> has a great future and it will eventually be accepted as a currency for payment.</p>\n<h2>Early Beginnings in the Crypto World</h2>\n<p>Moreno-Sanchez was pursuing his Ph.D. at Saarland University in April 2013 under the supervision of Aniket Kate when he first heard of <a title="" href="http://bitcoin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin</a>. It was his mentor Aniket who introduced him to cryptocurrencies for the very first time.</p>\n<p>The concept was new for Moreno-Sanchez, but he found it interesting that a new way of sending payments over the internet could be developed. Since he came from a background of working and solving networking problems, the idea of a global decentralized currency appealed more to him.</p>\n<p>He started learning more about bitcoin and blockchain and eventually, his first paper was addressed a security issue in IoT products. He has since contributed to <a title="" href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pmorenos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 research papers</a> mainly dealing with increasing privacy across cryptocurrency networks.</p>\n<h2>Research Paper for CoinShuffle Released in 2014</h2>\n<p>In September 2014, Moreno-Sanchez along with his mentor Aniket Kate and another scholar Tim Ruffing authored a paper in which they proposed a new system to increase the privacy of users. The proposed idea, if implemented, would make it impossible for anyone to track the history of a coin or to conclude who the owner of each coin is.</p>\n<p>It was stated, “In this paper, we propose CoinShuﬄe, a completely decentralized Bitcoin mixing protocol that allows users to utilize Bitcoin in a truly anonymous manner.” It was based on the accountable anonymous group communication protocol <a title="" href="http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dissent</a> and claimed to be better than most previous attempts made to address this issue.</p>\n<p>Suppose there is one user sitting exactly at the every edge of an n-sided pentagon. Every user has one coin with him and he does not know who are the other users sitting next to him. All these users then randomly pass their coins in a predefined manner such that no user is left with his original coin. At the end, every user will have one coin but it will be different from the original coin he originally had.By mixing coins of several users and then transfers them a new set of coins from the mixed coins, CoinShuffle can achieve an improvement in privacy. </p>\n<p>Previous attempts made to enhance the privacy of users by mixing coins would use a centralized server which would increase the risk of the network failing or getting tampered with. CoinShuffle, however, used a <a title="" href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/02fd/71524e15de535d5e7aa6f79743352cac3992.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">P2P mixing</a> protocol that had no central server as it was mixing the coins among users who were doing the actual work.</p>\n<h2>Limitations of CoinShuffle Led to CoinShuffle++</h2>\n<p>The idea to let users work and mix their coins with each other worked fine for a small set of users, but the problem grew when it was tested among large users, as it increased the time it took to perform the operations by each user in a linear fashion.</p>\n<p>Moreno-Sanchez says, “The system worked fine for a less number of users but it would take almost seven minutes if there were 50 users who were part of the network.”</p>\n<p>Due to this limitation, it was impossible to roll out a working model for bitcoin as the cryptocurrency’s blockchain would process several thousands of transactions every day among all its users.</p>\n<p>To do away with the disadvantage, Moreno-Sanchez and his team envisioned CoinShuffle++, which modified the protocol slightly to change the linear nature and perform the operations all at once instead . Praising it, he said, “It would take us seven minutes with 50 users, but now it took us less than seven seconds even with 100 plus users.”</p>\n<h2>ValueShuffle</h2>\n<p>ValueShuffle was then conceptualized in a <a title="" href="https://people.mmci.uni-saarland.de/~truffing/papers/valueshuffle.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research paper</a> ‘Mixing Conﬁdential Transactions: Comprehensive Transaction Privacy for Bitcoin’ in 2017 and is an extension of CoinShuffle++. It successfully combines coin mixing, and two partial privacy solutions namely Stealth Addresses and Confidential Transactions (CT). Since with CoinShuffle++ the amounts were public, the shuffle required users to have the same numbers of bitcoins. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>“The combination of technologies provides the privacy guarantees of interest in Bitcoin. ValueShuﬄe ensures that no attacker observing the blockchain or the network, or even participating in the protocol, can link inputs and outputs of the CoinJoin transaction created in an execution of ValueShuﬄe.”</b><b></b></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once CT is available on Bitcoin, ValueShuffle can be easily integrated, &#8220;&#8230;we can directly apply ValueShuffle, we not only get the performance of CoinShuffle++ but we also manage to hide the amounts being shuffled and certain other properties associated with CT,&#8221; Moreno-Sanchez remarked.</p>\n<p>On his thoughts about the timeframe surrounding the implementation of CT, he said from a technical point of view, &#8220;there are not any technical challenges or disadvantages with CT, and I hope in the next few months it will be accepted and integrated.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Moreno-Sanchez is bullish on the future of bitcoin, saying that researchers are really interested in the protocol, it would become a widely adopted currency soon serving as an alternative for payments. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com/pedro-moreno-sanchez-speaks-about-coinshuffle-and-the-future-of-bitcoin/">Pedro Moreno-Sanchez Speaks About CoinShuffle and the Future of Bitcoin</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com">BTCMANAGER</a>.</p>',

As is usual with any launch, Justin Sun was there to inspire the Tron fans and HODLers and reiterate the vision of the project to decentralize the web. The recording of the live event has been uploaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJo7bCXgzao">on Youtube</a> for you to re-watch. Justin would later accompany the MainNet event with further outlining the vision of TRON as an Independent blockchain from Ethereum&rsquo;s.</p>\n<h5>The big question is, and with the enthusiasm of the Tron team, will Tron (TRX) eventually outshine Ethereum?</h5>\n<h5>The next question is, how will TRON achieve that?</h5>\n<p>To begin with, and outlined by Justin Sun in <a href="https://medium.com/@Tronfoundation/letter-to-the-community-odyssey-2-0-7e440100c463">the letter</a> to the Tron members, the Tron MainNet platform will be different than Ethereum&rsquo;s due to the fact that it is built using the Java programming language. This means it is easier to program on the TRON Odyssey V2.0 platform than it is for a developer to learn the Solidity programming language necessary to create Decentralized Apps on the Ethereum platform.</p>\n<p>Still, on the needs of the developer, the <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-still-a-fan-favorite-and-a-safe-bet-moving-forward/">TRON</a> platform can handle more transactions per second (TPS) and hence obliterating network congestion as seen on ETH during the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/loveable-digital-kittens-clogging-ethereums-blockchain/">Crypto-Kitties</a> launch last year. This, in turn, makes it a favorite for any developer who wants to create the next level of fast DApps.</p>\n<p>The second reason the TRON MainNet might outshine Ethereum is the new concept of democratizing the platform using Super Representation. Any TRX can leverage his/her coins so as to be part of the decision making in the community. This is the complete opposite of the ETH platform where the foundation makes all the decisions. By allowing for true decentralization, users know their input is going to be considered and implemented in a democratic manner.</p>\n<p>The third, and most likely the biggest reason TRON MainNet might outshine Ethereum&rsquo;s platform, is the amount of community support the project has gathered. Currently, TRON Odyssey 2.0 has accumulated 2,153 commits on <a href="https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/releases">Github</a>, merged 547 forks, released 15 software iterations, and added 102 new features. The team has also performed 384 unit tests, 461 function tests and managed to scrutinize the code to guarantee it is secure for release.</p>\n<p>Also to add, and with respect to the Tron Community, is that TRX holders number 1.08 Million compared to EOS&rsquo; holders who number 306,000. This makes TRON the project with the highest HODLers on the ETH platform who will soon migrate to the MainNet by the 25th of June. Justin also has over 448,000 followers on Twitter and the project has over 3.82 Million related videos on youtube. This means that the community support is unlike no other.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-tron-trx-live-up-to-the-hype-despite-crashing-during-the-mainnet-launch/">Tron</a> project might end up eventually eclipsing its parent platform, Ethereum, due to the reasons highlighted above. Current market analysis shows that TRX is yet to pick up in the crypto-market after the MainNet launch a few days ago. TRX is currently valued at $0.058 at the moment of writing this and down almost 5% in 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Although <strong>BTC</strong> remains well below its 50 (blue line) and 200 (red line) day moving averages, the short-term action is somewhat encouraging.</p>\n<p>While the inverted H&amp;S formation requires further work, both investors/traders may want to utilize the following levels as a guide in order to garner further clues/evidence with respect to direction.</p>\n<p>If, at any point in the days ahead, <strong>BTC</strong> can go top-side of the 7730 figure and &lsquo;stick&rsquo; and perhaps more importantly, clear the 8020 level, such development/s, should they materialize, would certainly be a welcome relief and begin to repair some of the recent technical damage despite still trading below both its 50 and 200DMA&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>On the flip-side, if<strong> BTC</strong> is unable to overcome the 7730 level and &lsquo;stick&rsquo; and subsequently &lsquo;takes-out&rsquo; the 7260 level at any time in the days/weeks ahead, such would likely suggest that the potential inverted H&amp;S formation would once again be a failure and would also more than likely precipitate additional selling pressure.</p>\n<p>Thus, while the recent short-term action is encouraging as well as providing some much-needed relief, further work remains before we can declare that <strong>BTC</strong> is out of the woods and in the clear.</p>\n<p>Moving on to Ethereum <strong>(ETH)</strong>, we can see from the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chart</a> below that, much like <strong>BTC</strong>, Ethereum is also forming a potential mini inverted H&amp;S formation and attempting to move up-and-out.</p>\n<p><a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETHUSD.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5934 size-full" src="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETHUSD.png" alt="" width="739" height="396" srcset="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETHUSD.png 739w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETHUSD-300x161.png 300w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETHUSD-370x198.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></p>\n<p>While Ethereum also finds itself trading below both its 50 and 200DMA&rsquo;s, representing a poor technical posture as we can observe above,&nbsp;<strong>ETH</strong>&nbsp;is not nearly as far beneath its moving averages as that of <strong>BTC</strong>.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, if, at any time in the days ahead, <strong>ETH</strong>&nbsp;is capable of clearing the hurdle located at the 650 level and can &lsquo;stick&rsquo;, which coincidentally is where we find the 50-day moving average, such development, should it occur, would certainly be a positive development. On the other side of the ledger, should <strong>ETH</strong> breach the 538 figure, such occurrence would likely render the inverted H&amp;S formation null-and-void.</p>\n<p>Looking at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chart</a>&nbsp;of Litecoin <strong>(LTC)</strong> below, much like both <strong>BTC</strong> as well as <strong>ETH</strong>, Litecoin finds itself in a similar position attempting to move up-and-out of its mini potential inverted H&amp;S formation as well as trading well below both its 50 and 200-day moving averages.</p>\n<p><a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LTCUSD.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5935 size-full" src="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LTCUSD.png" alt="" width="739" height="396" srcset="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LTCUSD.png 739w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LTCUSD-300x161.png 300w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LTCUSD-370x198.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></p>\n<p>When viewing the action of <strong>LTC</strong> above, it&rsquo;s apparent that it finds itself in a similar technical posture as that of both <strong>BTC</strong> and <strong>ETH</strong>.</p>\n<p>Thus, moving forward, both investors/traders may want to monitor the following levels for additional clues/evidence with regards to direction.</p>\n<p>If, at any point in the days ahead,&nbsp;<strong>LTC</strong> is capable of going top-side of the 129.30 level and perhaps more importantly, the 141 figure, such development, should it occur, would surely be a positive step for <strong>LTC</strong>. Whereas, if <strong>LTC</strong> should happen to breach the 114.25 level at any time in the days ahead, such development, should it occur, would suggest that its potential inverted H&amp;S formation would be a failure.</p>\n<p>Last, but certainly not least, we take a look at <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BCHUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Cash</a> below, as <strong>BCH</strong> may just find itself in a better position presently than the aforementioned above.</p>\n<p><a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BCHUSD.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5938 size-full" src="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BCHUSD.png" alt="" width="739" height="396" srcset="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BCHUSD.png 739w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BCHUSD-300x161.png 300w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BCHUSD-370x198.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></p>\n<p>As we can observe from the action above, <strong>BCH</strong>, like <strong>BTC</strong>; <strong>ETH</strong> and <strong>LTC</strong>&nbsp;also find itself in the process of forming its very own potential inverted H&amp;S formation.</p>\n<p>However, unlike <strong>BTC; ETH</strong> as well as <strong>LTC</strong>, which have yet to clear their respective initial hurdles and &lsquo;stick&rsquo; &ndash; thus far,&nbsp;<strong>BCH</strong> has indeed cleared and is holding its initial hurdle located at the 1153 level.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, if <strong>BCH</strong> can continue to hold the 1153 figure and perhaps of more importance, can clear its 50DMA, presently located at the 1244 level, such would certainly go a long way in repairing some of the short-term technical damage that has been inflicted over the past several weeks. On the flip-side of the coin, should <strong>BCH</strong> lose the 941 level at any point in the days ahead, such would more than likely suggest that lower prices are in the offing.</p>\n<p>Thus, of the four names we&rsquo;ve focused on in this report, <strong>BCH</strong> presently finds itself leading the way, while <strong>BTC</strong>; <strong>ETH</strong> as well as <strong>LTC</strong> have further work in order to complete their potential inverted head-and-shoulders formations.</p>\n<p>While the present overall climate finds itself reaping some welcome short-term relief in the absence of storm clouds, as we have suspected, further work remains before we can declare the coast is clear.</p>\n<p>Happy Trading!!</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our <a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

After first announcing his candidacy with the newly formed “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiWcch4dkmE">Cyber Party</a>” (which is not as dirty as it sounds) the viral tycoon joined the race for the Libertarian nomination instead. He polled well among Libertarian primary voters, and came in <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-gary-johnson-libertarian-presidential-nomination-20160529-story.html">second</a> place behind former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>\n<p>After working as a programmer for NASA and Lockheed, McAfee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McAfee#After_McAfee_Associates">struck gold</a> during the first internet boom, when he introduced the antivirus program that still bears his name. He eventually sold the software to Intel, along with his name, before embarking on a spree of sometimes-reckless technology investments. After some bad luck in the ‘90s and 2000’s—with some Trumpian echoes—the $100 million dollar McAfee fortune had shrunk to about $4 million, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/business/economy/21inequality.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>\n<p>By 2008, his fortune seriously in decline, McAfee retired to Belize. By now his reputation had moved from “eccentric tycoon” to “expat weirdo” and rumors of his lifestyle became legendary—from his <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kwn5yy/john-mcafee-bath-salts-belize-murder-fugitive-gregory-faull">predilections</a> for butt drugs and sex yoga, to guns and prostitutes. Eventually McAfee fell afoul of local police on suspicion of murder, or—by his own <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/john-mcafee-what-really-happened-in-belize-2016-5">telling</a>—was framed by corrupt officials,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>leading to a government raid on his compound and a flight to Guatemala.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>\n<p>Somewhere in there, McAfee struck gold again, this time in Bitcoin.

She is also working with IOHK&rsquo;s Chief Scientist, Prof. Aggelos Kiayias at the IOHK research lab at the University of Edinburgh. She spoke about how she came across IOHK and what insisted her on working with them. She also mentions her role, duties, and goals as the Senior Research Manager at IOHK.</p>\n<p>Wester has a background in speech technology and a Ph.D. in automatic speech recognition. For the last 18 months, she has been working with Aggelos on a new project in privacy and security called Panoramix. During the course of this project, she was introduced to IOHK.</p>\n<p>As the senior research manager at IOHK, she will be supporting the senior management in managing the different research streams at IOHK. She will be focussing on the different processes to make sure they are in place, hoping to improve them and making it all more efficient.</p>\n<p>IOHK works with different universities, so there is blockchain technology lab in Edinburgh, where she started off. Last week, she was in Tokyo where she had the opportunity to meet the researcher fellows &#8211; Bernardo, Mario, and the Tokyo tech.</p>\n<p>With the way IOHK has grown in the last year, a lot more management is needed to ensure that the different projects stick to the time frames they need to stick to. It is important and exciting to try to get people to work together and facilitate the collaboration between researchers and developers because they talk different languages and sometimes need help to ensure that their communication is more efficient, says Wester.</p>\n<p>She concluded stating:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So, I hope to contribute to that and make life better for everybody who is working here at IOHK.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cardano and its team have always been focussing on the R7D as much as they do with any other sector of their project. Charles Hoskinson, the Founder of IOHK himself mentioned the importance and the amount of effort that his research team puts all the time to make their currency the best. With a new, experienced research manager to manage some of the most important works of theirs, they look forward to an improvised and much more efficient team.</p>\n<p>Jason Whittle, a speculator commented:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Must be a lot of research going on to need someone to manage it.

The project wraps up smart contracts, oracles, and distributed computation, bringing them to the IOTA platform. While other platforms offer distributed computation for a tokenized fee, the IOTA tangle should, in theory, use users&rsquo; resources to be scalable and perform the computations, or complete the smart contracts, for free.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class="twitterembedcontainer">\n<p>IOTA oracles will supply information about the outside world, and tie them to the functioning of smart contracts. While creating a smart contract on many platforms is trivial, creating the right oracles for the contract has been limited in the world of crypto coins. There are expectations that future projects may add tokenization to the IOTA tangle, turning the project into one of the cheapest platforms to serve smart contracts and aid in fast token creation.</p>\n<p>But the expectations that the Qubic launch would be immediate bullish news for IOTA did not materialize, at least in the short term. The market price of MIOTA sank by more than 13% overnight, to $1.71. The big run up for IOTA happened in the days before, still showing a weekly gain of over 19%.</p>\n<p>It seems like a surprise that IOTA has set out to become one of the &ldquo;Ethereum killer&rdquo; projects, with an entirely new product and ecosystem. IOTA has aimed to become the digital asset system for the Internet of Things. However, the real-life applications of IoT have been slow to arrive, and IOTA has lagged behind.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="de">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">IOTA&lsquo;s Qubic is absolutely revolutionary and offers a huge spectrum of potential use cases.

At the moment, MIOTA owners have to rely on exchanges, and simpler wallets that sometimes have trouble finding the balances.</p>\n<p>The IOTA Trinity wallet is currently in beta release, and is seen as one of the indicators of success for the project. Without an intuitive and easy wallet, many crypto coins have lagged in adoption. The Trinity Beta announcement was the reason for the recent spike in IOTA. But now, prices are back with a renewed downward trend.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://cryptovest.com/news/iota-greets-launch-of-qubic-project-aims-to-become-complete-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IOTA Greets Launch of Qubic Project, Aims to Become Complete Ecosystem</a> was originally published on <a href="https://cryptovest.com/feed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cryptovest.com/feed</a>.

Most of the time, it pushes the rivals to their limits, with each of them trying to become better and come out on top. The same goes for the world of cryptos, and this time, we will take a look at how <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-tron-trx-live-up-to-the-hype-despite-crashing-during-the-mainnet-launch/">TRON (TRX)</a> rivals with <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/can-stellar-xlm-replace-ripple-xrp/">Ripple (XRP)</a>.</p>\n<h3>TRON vs Ripple</h3>\n<p>For most of its &ldquo;life&rdquo; TRON was mostly compared to <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ethereum-eth-price-dips-eos-eos-event-responsible-for-the-drop/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, due to the underlying tech of the currencies. Lately, however, a new rivalry has been hinted at, and this one puts TRON against Ripple.</p>\n<p>The two are not exactly traditional rivals, which is obvious once you take a look at what they are trying to achieve. Ripple&rsquo;s aim was always at financial institutions and major banks, and its goal was to become the crypto of choice for entities belonging to this category. <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-the-tron-trx-mainnet-eventually-outshine-ethereums-platform/">TRON</a>, on the other hand, has been focusing on doing the same, but in the sphere of the digital entertainment industry.</p>\n<p>However, even with their focuses being in entirely different fields, these cryptos seem to be a lot alike when it comes to certain sets of features. Since Ripple&rsquo;s development came first, it is more than obvious that TRON&rsquo;s team has done things in a similar way on purpose, by being inspired by Ripple&rsquo;s methods.</p>\n<p>Some of these similarities include low-to-nonexistent transaction fees, great transfer speed, significant liquidity, as well as scalability. Because of this, many are expecting TRON to go as far as to replacing Ripple.</p>\n<h3>Why do we expect so much of TRON?</h3>\n<p>With TRON&rsquo;s successful launch of TestNet, as well as its launch of MainNet only a few days ago, it is obvious that TRON is advancing. Its current price is at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/">$0.060717</a>, and it has yet to rise following the launch of the MainNet. However, there are several other reasons why this currency is expected to succeed Ripple, and become an even bigger name in the world of cryptos.</p>\n<p>The first reason for this is its market utility. Ripple has been known as an industry leader when it comes to offering utility and has managed to hold its own, while many other cryptos have not been able to come anywhere near its heights. Its transaction fees were only a fraction of a penny, which has made Ripple very popular crypto for making transactions.</p>\n<p>However, TRON has managed to come very close to matching this achievement, and it will only continue to improve, now that the MainNet is live. Other than that, it is important to remember that TRON is created so that it can scale. It offers over 1000 transactions per second, which will become one of the most important features after the prices finally stabilize, and we are able to go beyond that issue. Add to that the fact that transactions are basically free, and TRON will easily become one of the best methods of sending money.</p>\n<p>The second reason for TRON&rsquo;s rise is the fact that it has found its own industry where it can dominate. While XRP has been concentrating on banks, TRON went for digital entertainment. This was a smart decision, considering the popularity of gaming around the world, which has been on the rise for decades, now. Another smart thing that TRON did is choosing an industry and sticking to it, instead of trying to tackle as many as it could at the same time.</p>\n<p>The third reason includes the confidence that the crypto is getting from its parent company. For XRP, that is the company Ripple. It owns and controls the crypto, and it doesn&rsquo;t allow anyone else to mine it. Due to its reputation and business strength, the price of XRP has been a bit more stable than those of other cryptos. At the same time, the banks decided that it is worthy of their trust.</p>\n<p>TRON, however, can use the same method of verification thanks to Justin Sun, and the TRON Foundation. Sun has been more than just TRX&rsquo;s creator. He has proven to be an invaluable asset to TRON and was directly responsible for its growth. He has managed to capture the interest of investors and focus it into his crypto. It is safe to say that TRON would not have been nearly as close to its current position if not for Sun and his marketing skills.</p>\n<h3>Coinbase might go for TRON over Ripple</h3>\n<p>Coinbase has been one of the biggest names when it comes to crypto exchanges, and for quite some time, too. Its preference of cryptos has not changed that much over that time, and it has been very picky regarding which coins it will support and offer.</p>\n<p>Lately, however, there were speculations that it might give a chance to several other coins, and it is largely believed that TRON might be the one that will join, rather than Ripple.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons for this potential decision as well. For example, Coinbase&rsquo;s goal is to generate more trading. By accepting TRON, it can easily do this due to its popularity. Also, getting TRON is much cheaper than getting XRP, and the coin still has very high volume. Also, TRON was rumored to be going to a new base in San Francisco, which would make it much closer to Coinbase, which is based in the same city.</p>\n<p>Not to mention the rumor that was later confirmed, and that states that Feng Li, who is an investor in both TRON and Coinbase might have more than enough power to influence this decision. So yes, if TRON gets the opportunity to join Coinbase, it will definitely not waste it, and many believe that this might happen before the year&rsquo;s end.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Enthusiasts across the globe, are acknowledging its existence and have started taking interest in its working. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University Blockchain Research Initiative or UBRI is one such initiative which accommodates 17 research-oriented universities coming together to fulfill the endeavor that they sought to pursue.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborative partnership with universities from Australia, the US, the Netherlands, Brazil, India, South Korea, the UK, Luxembourg, Cyprus, and Canada will be thus observed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent tweet goes,</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re committing $50M to top, global universities to further #blockchain research, tech and talent for our new University Blockchain Research Initiative!”.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With UBRI, the universities across the globe wish to reformulate their curriculums, in sync with the current foreplay. And consecutively, equip themselves with the latest knowledge base on financial technology and the new concept of crypto world asserting its presence.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Also, read: <a title="22 European Countries Join International Blockchain Partnership" href="https://coingape.com/eu-blockchain-partnership-of-22-countries/?utm_source=read_more&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="bookmark">22 European Countries Join International Blockchain Partnership</a></strong></span></em></p>\n<h3><b>Crypto market seeking collaborations extensively </b></h3>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day in and out, the news of some or the other big crypto being associated with some prestigious linkups is going on air. It seems that the crypto market is also coming in the reaches of the marketing strategies to large extent.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent move of <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-announcement-new-pairs-xrp-usdt/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple </a>funding the UBRI is one amongst many such moves in foreplay of the market setup. Recently we saw many other cryptocurrencies that are joining hands with the number of corporations from different industries. Owing to the statistical approach, everyone is realizing the need for collaborations and the world platforms that they could seek for their representation.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global trends are now that of partnerships and do not even pay heed to isolations anymore. Thus a market that was earlier existing in isolation is slowly and steadily moving towards a “mix-up”.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the current market trends for the crypto accounts for a gloomy <a href="https://coingape.com/ripple-xrp-momentum-xrp-price-to-roof/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decline </a>of 3.7% with the present value at $0.64 USD, it might change to a soaring one soon. As suggested by the analysts in market space, the figures changing to an upward surge is primarily the expectation in prevalence. As drawn from the market trends in foreplay, it has now become more or less an expected move for a currency facing decline, to indulge in associations.</span></p>\n<p><strong>It would now be interesting to see, whether Ripple gets back on its price track with its latest UBRI associations or not? What do you opine in this regard?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class="optinengine_after_post"></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coingape.com/ripple-set-breakthroughs-education-sector/">After Finance, Ripple [XRP] Set to make Breakthroughs in Education Sector</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coingape.com">Coingape</a>.</p>',

The sheer amount of EOS makes it unlikely for the owner make use of a hot wallet.</p>\n<p>In fact, the top ten addresses may not be of a single person/entity, and may even be an interaction between two different exchanges.</p>\n<p>Based on the trading volume data available on CoinMarketCap, cryptocurrency exchanges, OKEx, Bithumb, Upbit, Binance, Bitfinex, Huobi, and Block.one have <a title="" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos/#markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handled over $150 million</a> of EOS transactions in the past 24 hours at press time.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31120" src="https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/EOS-Exchanges.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="323" srcset="https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/EOS-Exchanges.jpg 1366w, https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/EOS-Exchanges-350x197.jpg 350w, https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/EOS-Exchanges-768x432.jpg 768w, https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/EOS-Exchanges-800x450.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">Source: <a title="" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos/#markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>CoinMarketCap</i></a></p>\n<p>Interestingly, as <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/8o7cdw/eos_rich_listgenesis_snapshot_statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a> by Reddit user Lannisan, the top 100 EOS addresses hold 748,176,831 tokens of 74.82 percent of all EOS tokens. Also, the top 1000 accounts hold over 858,120,383 tokens or 85 percent of the total circulating supply.  </p>\n<h2>Not All Can be Exchanges</h2>\n<p>As per CoinMarketCap’s data, only 50 exchanges handled upwards of $1 million EOS in the 24 hours preceding press time, with multiple exchanges repeated to denote the different currency pairs. Hence, at least 75 addresses of the top 100 are not exchanges and hold over $250 million cumulatively.</p>\n<p>Next, an individual/entity would require only 646,595 tokens or $10 million to be part of the exclusive top 100 EOS account club. By all means, this would grant the holder major voting rights.</p>\n<p>According to analytics site Token Analyst, they estimate the percentage of all tokens held by exchanges is <a title="" href="https://www.tokenanalyst.io/token/20/EOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just under 20 percent</a>.</p>\n<h2>Skewed Voting Rights</h2>\n<p>It must be noted that the list does not represent the actual number of EOS holders, as an entity can have more than one address, i.e., the top ten could, in reality, be just five entities.</p>\n<p>Now comes the important part; as per the EOS protocol, shareholder voting is weighted on the number of tokens held. And in this case, ten percent of the total votes can indeed be decisive. With such a high concentration of EOS tokens in the top ten, it becomes almost impossible for these holders to lose if they collude.</p>\n<p>However, with the limitations of the data at hand, it is hard to say for sure whether these addresses are linked to exchanges, as some are vying for Block Producer status &#8211; Block Producers have a chance at being nominated to be one of EOS&#8217;s 21 supernodes. Nevertheless, the distribution fares worse than Ethereum&#8217;s in its early days:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It was nowhere near this bad and ETH didn’t rely on voting to choose block producers who in EOS stand to profit to the tune of of multiple millions per year. <a href="https://t.co/xw7eNQUZ7y">https://t.co/xw7eNQUZ7y</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; panek (@panekkkk) <a href="https://twitter.com/panekkkk/status/1003414928793874432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>For example, Bitfinex, which is holding over $200 million in EOS, after a strike of fortune develops close relations with Block.one. According to <a title="" href="https://www.tokenanalyst.io/token/20/EOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Token Analyst</a>, the exchange holds 17,415,204.89 tokens, less than 50 percent of what Bithumb holds, with Huobi and OKEx also having more considerable holdings. Bitfinex and Block.one (which now hold over 20 percent of voting rights) will cumulatively hold more voting power than the top 1000 account holders.</p>\n<p>One may think that decentralization may come to the rescue of retail investors. However, this is not proving to be the case. Of the four groups that were trying to launch the mainnet, only one chain will be launched, <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/8o5p0g/eos_mainnet_launch_update/e00zxpb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegedly due to</a> EOS Chief Technical Officer Dan Larimer’s influence.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com/eos-snapshot-reveals-10-accounts-hold-almost-50-percent-of-tokens-voting-rights-massively-inequal/">EOS Snapshot Reveals 10 Accounts Hold Almost 50 percent of Tokens: Voting Rights Massively Inequal</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com">BTCMANAGER</a>.</p>',

Then EOS (EOS) stole the headlines <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-price-jumps-on-news-of-eosio-10-release-50-mln-fund-to-support-ecosystem">with double-digit gains</a> of the token ahead of the MainNet launch that happened on the 2nd of June. Both projects have been hailed as possible Ethereum Killers and the next generation of smart contract platforms with higher transactions per second and other better features.</p>\n<h5>Will Ethereum (ETH) survive the onslaught of these two MainNets?</h5>\n<p>For now, Ethereum can be considered as being safe from any threats of Tron or EOS Mainnets taking over as the preferred platforms for Decentralized Applications and smart contracts. Ethereum has already created a foundation for dominance.</p>\n<h5>How will Ethereum (ETH) still thrive amongst the competition?</h5>\n<p>To begin with, Ethereum (ETH) is time-tested and has weathered the storm that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/07/a-major-vulnerability-has-frozen-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-of-ethereum/">was security vulnerabilities</a>&nbsp;discovered earlier on in the year as well as the constant FUD with respect to low transactions per second. Yes, the ETH network does get congested due to DApps about animals and kitties, but there is no other stable platform out there that have been tested such as Ethereum. Also to note is the current conversation of <a href="http://bitcoinist.com/vitalik-buterin-sharding-plasma-scale-ethereum-10000-times/">introducing sharding</a> on the ETH network. When this concept materializes, ETH will obliterate any competition.</p>\n<p>EOS on the other hand <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-eos-will-weather-the-storm-of-vulnerabilities-and-come-out-stronger/">recently had</a> a very serious security issue right before the MainNet launch that left many speculating if the MainNet would launch. What was found on the EOS platform, was a vulnerability where a malicious hacker would create and execute a smart contract that would technically hijack the nodes to cause a full-blown cyber attack on other crypto networks. This issue has since been resolved but questions still linger.</p>\n<p>When we analyze the current <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-still-a-fan-favorite-and-a-safe-bet-moving-forward/">Tron</a> project, the foundation has implemented a $10 Million Bug Bounty program to any developer or team of developers that can find any security vulnerabilities before the 24th of June this year. Also to note is the presence of a Tron hackathon in the Tron Project Genesis calendar to further test the Odyssey MainNet for vulnerabilities. This means the MainNet still has a long way to go in terms of gaining trust from DApp developers and showing network stability.</p>\n<p>With respect to market dominance, Ethereum (ETH) is firmly in the number 2 position behind Bitcoin (BTC) and according to market capitalization. As a matter of fact, many Crypto analysts have predicted that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/ethereum-price-latest-updates-bitcoin-cash-roger-ver-crytocurrency-flippening-a8345166.html">ETH will flippen Bitcoin</a> before the end of the year. This means that even crypto-traders still find favor with ETH when it comes to the crypto-markets.</p>\n<p>In summary, both TRON and EOS MainNet platforms are a welcome addition to the crypto-verse platform arena. However, they have a long way to go for them to be considered as potential Ethereum Killers with respect to being platforms of choice and general popularity. ETH is also eons ahead when you consider its market presence with respect to both TRX and EOS.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

What has resulted in the partnership is the formation of SBI Ripple Asia that has spearheaded the adoption of Ripple technologies in the region as well as innovation in the industry of fintech. So far, Ripple has access to over 61 banks in the consortium that makes up SBI Holdings.</p>\n<p>It is, therefore, no surprise that the SBI Group wants to release a cryptocurrency exchange that plans to utilize XRP as the centerpiece for trading on the platform. The exchange, known as SBI Virtual Currencies, has updated <a href="https://www.sbivc.co.jp/">its website</a> and is now live for trading for users who had pre-registered back in October 2017. One thing to note is that XRP is the only cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.sbivc.co.jp/support/cryptocurrency/">on the site</a> that has been described in terms of what it is and its capabilities. The exchange will alter add Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as the second traded digital asset on the platform.</p>\n<p>This means that the CEO and President of SBI Holdings, Yoshitaka Kitao, was serious when he said that once the exchange is ready, it will feature primarily XRP and the exchange will eventually <a href="https://www.businessinsider.jp/post-166536">be number one</a>. The exchange had been scheduled for launch this summer and the XRP HODLers and the entire crypto-verse is applauding and excited with the launch today, June 4th.</p>\n<p>One thing to remember is that the country of Japan is home to over <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/04/10/cryptocurrency-trade-statistics-japan/">3.5 Million</a> crypto traders and HODLers. These traders are between the ages of 20 and 40. This will be the target demographic of the new crypto exchange by the SBI Holdings Group.</p>\n<p>With respect to the cryptocurrency markets, they are still showing some upward mobility in terms of gains since the entire market came to its knees on Tuesday, the 29th of May. On this date, the total market capitalization of the crypto markets came to a recent low of $303 Billion and Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $7,100 levels. The crypto markets have since regained $40 Billion at the moment of writing this and the total market capitalization stands at $345 Billion.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin (BTC) is now trading at $7,629 and looks like it is on its way to levels close to $8,000. With respect to Ethereum, the coin is now valued at $621. Our beloved Ripple (XRP) is currently valued at $0.67 and up 3% in 24 hours. The aforementioned launch of the SBI Virtual Currencies exchange is what many Ripple HODLers were waiting for this summer.&nbsp; Expectations of the platform are high in terms of assisting XRP to reach the <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ripple-xrp-5-usd-possible/">$5 levels</a> everyone is asking about.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Through Ubcoin Market, a person would be able to sell something they own &ndash; such as a second-hand iPhone or a homemade ring &ndash; in exchange for UBC, the platform&rsquo;s native utility token. These tokens can then either be converted into&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> or Ethereum, or be used to make other purchases in the marketplace.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">According to&nbsp;<a  href="https://ubcoin.io/" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Ubcoin Market</a>, this is a compelling alternative to unregulated crypto exchanges, where a person&rsquo;s capital can be in grave danger if the company is hacked.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Its team told Cointelegraph: &ldquo;Everything is legal and secure: the most thorough due diligence executed by Ubcoin&rsquo;s legal team has identified in target countries no direct discrepancies with and violations of the laws of the countries that regulate exchange of owned goods for digital tokens.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>All the operations related to wallet management &mdash; deposits and withdrawals, as well as transactions &mdash; are regulated through Ethereum-based smart contracts. While goods are in transit, the platform holds users&rsquo; tokens in escrow, and they are not released to the seller if the buyer is not happy with the goods. In case anything goes wrong, the deal goes to a two-tier dispute arbitration that is provided by the platform.</p>\n\n<p>The company says it uses neural networks to detect unacceptable texts and images in seller postings. Any accounts showing suspicious patterns of behavior will be blocked. The AI tool will be constantly learning from users&rsquo; actions, content, and complaints.</p>\n\n<h2>Partnerships with tech giants</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The blockchain-based Ubcoin Market is being developed by Ubank, a company which was established in 2009. Ubank describes itself as a &ldquo;leader in mobile finance in Eastern Europe,&rdquo; and its current app has been installed more than 16 mln times worldwide.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a  href="https://en.ubank.ru/" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Ubank</a> has a long-running and exclusive partnership with Samsung, which involves its app being pre-installed on the tech giant&rsquo;s smartphones &ndash; including the flagship Galaxy S9. The company says this relationship is set to continue and flourish when Ubcoin Market is released, with the platform initially being made available to 2.5 mln active users once it has been integrated into Ubank.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Felix Khachatryan, the CEO of Ubank, said: &ldquo;Our partnership with Samsung is a completely unique story. It is unique in not only that the world&rsquo;s largest mobile phone manufacturer has been steadily collaborating with us on three different projects almost 10 years now, but it has also been encouraging all of our experiments. This kind of opportunity is not given to any other player &ndash; even the most prominent ones &ndash; of the post-Soviet fintech market. That means a lot.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Excitement in Asia</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Ubcoin Market says there is great potential for its product, especially in Asia, which it describes as an &ldquo;extremely fertile ground for the mass adoption of goods-for-cryptocurrency exchanges&rdquo; like theirs.</p>\n\n<p>The company says this assessment has been reflected in the make-up of its contributor base during its ongoing token event &mdash; with contributors from China, Indonesia and South Korea dominating the token generation event so far.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Earlier this month,&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ubcoin-market-receives-investment-from-singapore-based-amereus-group-for-the-expansion-into-the-asian-market">Ubank announced</a> that it had received an undisclosed amount of funding from the Singapore-based VC fund Amereus Group, which is being used to further the development of the Ubcoin Market. The first institutional investor, Inventure Partners, contributed to the project in March.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The platform is scheduled to launch in the Middle East, South Asia and Western Europe in the second and third quarters of 2019, followed by expansion into Latin America and North America by 2020.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Ubcoin Market is currently in the fourth stage of its public token generation event, with a 13 percent discount being offered to contributors.</p>\n\n<div class="row">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div id="post-content">\n<p><span style="font-size: 12px; color: rgb(169, 169, 169);"><span style="font-weight: 600">Disclaimer.</span> Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

According to the platform, Q is going to be &ldquo;the most significant contribution to the IOTA stack&rdquo;. Simply put, it&rsquo;s a new era in which a limitless number of use cases could be applied. And Hodling just became such a familiar word.</p>\n<p>The IOTA just unleashed a weapon against those accusations that it wouldn&rsquo;t work for lack of nodes. What the new project will do is to combine a whole host of blockchain mechanisms into one protocol. Now there&rsquo;s Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, Proof of Bandwidth, and Proof of Honesty, all in the Q network.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentivize the community</strong></p>\n<p>According to the Qubic team, the protocol offers great incentives for anyone who wishes to run a node. One can let others use their spare computational power for a fee or rent out that extra storage capacity and earn rewards in the form of MIOTA. It, therefore, provides everyone with a chance to offer some service and get paid for the same.</p>\n<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you use Asics, GPUs or CPUs. For example, Q-nodes can be used to &ldquo;give new life to old, abandoned PCs&rdquo;. These seemingly useless PCs could be put to work, offering a great incentive to miners.</p>\n<p>And what it leads to is a massive network where a whole community could earn rewards using the oracles system, the smart contracts or from other users who buy computational resources.</p>\n<p><strong>New era begins</strong></p>\n<p>It is expected the project will take two years of further development before finally being deployed on the Tangle. The excitement with the Iota community is understandably palpable. According to Alexander Renz on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/iota-qubic-start-new-era-fulfillment-long-time-dream-alexander-renz/?published=t">LinkedIn</a>,</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Qubic introduces not only oracles and smart contracts, but quorum-based computations, a form of distributed computing. It essentially makes the IOTA Tangle programmable and leverages the data transfer protocol and peer-to-peer fee-less micro transactions to create incentives for outsourced computations using zero-fee micro-transactions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a possibility no other platform could achieve IoT and M2M as it is envisioned by the IOTA Foundation via the Qubic project. Alexander believes it&rsquo;ll completely change the game.</p>\n<p>He goes on to say that &ldquo;In the future, Qubic will leverage the worldwide available, unused computation capacity to solve all kinds of computational problems.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Messaging and payment app</strong></p>\n<p>Qubic began in 2012 as an idea to have a Quorum-based coin. However, that changed over time, evolving into the current form that sees it become a &ldquo;working protocol to serve as the messaging and payment system: IOTA.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Qubic follows in the footsteps of the original idea behind IOTA- to enable communication and payments in an IoT ecosystem. Indeed, the project&rsquo;s team acknowledges that it&rsquo;s been made possible as a result of the fee-free transactions on the IOTA network.</p>\n<p>Qubic works as a powerful distributed fog-computing platform. It&rsquo;s useful in the creation of complex IoT applications, and a new generation type of smart contracts. Furthermore, the network is designed to automatically collect micro-payments as it works and in real time.</p>\n<p><strong>IOTA (MIOTA) and the market</strong></p>\n<p>The excitement over the release of the Qubic project was a perfect event for the coin. It should, under normal circumstances, have helped push MIOTA prices a little higher. However, that hasn&rsquo;t happened and the coin&rsquo;s prices tanked further today.</p>\n<p>Like many other cryptocurrencies, IOTA had a very good end to the month of May. On May 29th, the coin traded at $136 against the US dollar. It rose within the three days to hit a new high of $2.00 on June 3, 2018. It later leveled off and closed the day at $181.</p>\n<p>Today it&rsquo;s trading at $1.71 (at the time of writing), has seen its value decline by 5.94% in the last 24 hours. That is the case over 24 hours, but in the last 7 days, the coin has seen a price growth of +20%.</p>\n<p>The token remains in 9th position with a market cap of $4.75 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $116 million.</p>\n<p>Even though the market hasn&rsquo;t responded to the event as though, one thing is not in doubt: the future of IOTA (MIOTA) appears better. What does that mean? HODL.</p>\n</p>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://stocksgazette.com/2018/06/04/iota-miotas-qubic-project-will-make-you-a-proud-hodler-new-era-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IOTA (MIOTA)&rsquo;s Qubic Project will make you a proud HODLer &ndash; New Era is Here</a> was originally published on <a href="https://stocksgazette.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://stocksgazette.com/</a>.

A trusted system requires checks and balances to ensure that the trust we place in it remains secure, while a trustless system does&nbsp;not.</p>\n<p>A good example of a trusted system is modern fiat currency. The money we hold in our bank accounts and wallets is backed only by the promise of the government printing it. It&rsquo;s up to the government to ensure that the currency stays stable and that goods and services can reliably be exchanged for it. The government is the intermediary guaranteeing the value of the currency and has to be trusted for any exchange to take&nbsp;place.</p>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*zSIqKndLLyPOwyq3eoE1KA.png" alt="Image result for trustless" /><figcaption>Trust is no longer mandatory</figcaption></figure>\n<p>DLT removes the need for intermediaries by anchoring the trustability of the system on the algorithms that it is composed of. It is mathematically incapable of duplicity and requires no mediation. By providing a trustless system without intermediaries, DLT opens up possibilities for people to interact in ways that has never existed before. This behavioral change will initiate the end for many industries that have long dominated society and signal the beginning for new ones based on a decentralized future.</p>\n<h3>IOTA is disrupting the DLT&nbsp;Space</h3>\n<p>IOTA is a DLT built specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. The team behind IOTA realized that in the IoT machine-economy of the future, millions of computers and sensors would need to interact and pay each other, often in micro and nano-payments. They also realized that blockchain networks wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle such transactions because of ever increasing transaction fees and scalability limits. Moreover, the energy-intensive mining and consensus mechanisms of traditional blockchains would not be a good fit with low cost IoT devices and intermittent networks.</p>\n<p>This meant that if the Internet of Things and DLT were ever going to merge, a new kind of &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; would need to be developed, which is exactly what the IOTA team created &ndash; the Tangle network. To be precise, the IOTA Tangle is not a blockchain. Instead it uses a data structure called Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and in doing so, the Tangle doesn&rsquo;t just maintain the original benefits of blockchain, it can improve on them exponentially.</p>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/624/0*6MoapD1SDBbxcLcJ.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Solving the blockchain&rsquo;s bottleneck</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The core innovation behind using a DAG is its ability to conduct zero-fee transactions and therefore, the ability to conduct nano-payments. This is achieved by cutting out miners and miner fees, which the Tangle in particular does by making validation of transactions an intrinsic part of the ledger&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;making miners (people validating transactions) and stakers (people sending transactions) one and the&nbsp;same.</p>\n<h3>Qubic: the missing&nbsp;puzzle</h3>\n<p>IOTA presented a novel DLT implementation: a blockchainless approach built specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT) and the machine-to-machine (M2M) economy. IOTA has the potential to bring virtually unlimited scalability and fee-less nano-transactions to the world. However, important features such as smart contracts were&nbsp;missing.</p>\n<p>Last week, the IOTA Foundation has brought an end to months of speculation surrounding <a href="https://twitter.com/iotatoken/status/1003305957932269568">the Qubic project</a>. Being touted as the most eagerly awaited development in the history of IOTA, the new project seeks to create a protocol that <em>&ldquo;specifies IOTA&rsquo;s solution for oracle machines, smart contracts, outsourced computations, and&nbsp;more.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Qubic introduces not only oracles and smart contracts, but quorum-based computations, a form of distributed computing. In short, Qubic makes the IOTA Tangle programmable and introduces a distributed computing environment where machines can establish trust, share data and pay each other for any resources using fee-less nano-transactions.</p>\n<h4>Oracles</h4>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*J2-6VrriC3E8nEmV.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Quorum consensus of an oracle&nbsp;assembly</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A DLT like the Tangle cannot access data outside its network. Oracles are third party services that find and verify real-world data and feed this data to a DLT to be used for computations (e.g. smart contracts&hellip;). Such data could be any data like weather temperature, successful payment, price fluctuations, etc.</p>\n<p>The incentive for oracles to stay honest is a reward system maintained by the qubic owners. Note that Qubic does not na&iuml;vely &ldquo;trust&rdquo; the third-party oracles. It ensures a high degree of certainty about the correctness of the data in question via a quorum consensus.</p>\n<h4>Smart Contracts</h4>\n<p>A smart contract is a computer protocol designed to emulate, and improve upon, the performance of a real-world contract. Its function is to define conditions which when met, execute a contract by the computers in a given network. Smart contracts are considered an innovative way of enhancing operational efficiencies and cutting costs for businesses, merchants and artisans&nbsp;alike.</p>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*kIi86ENePAgKfgwP.png" alt="" /><figcaption>A self-executing, trustless contract</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Smart contracts can automate many different kinds of processes and operations, such as payment and actions conditional on payment, giving rise to previously unimaginable levels of efficiency and precision. They are transforming how deals and transactions are executed and managed in business life-cycles. Some of the potential use cases for smart contracts include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital Identity and Financial Data Recording;</li>\n<li>Trade Finance, Derivatives and Securities;</li>\n<li>Mortgages and Land Title Recording;</li>\n<li>Supply Chain;</li>\n<li>Auto Insurance;</li>\n<li>Clinical Trials</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using IOTA as the backbone, Qubic&rsquo;s smart contracts go beyond these kinds of traditional smart contracts. The combination of fee-free transactions together with general-purpose quorum-based computation opens the door to entirely new possibilities. For example, a smart contract could be used to aggregate temperature data from different oracles into an average temperature, which gets published to the Tangle periodically. The smart contract has now become an oracle in and of itself&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;that is, the contract itself has become a source of external data, available for an oracle machine to pick up and send back to some other&nbsp;qubic.</p>\n<p>These types of smart contracts are also just iterations on the more general capacity for quorum-based computations. Qubic therefore also provides a standardized way to define, validate, and enforce the results of a smart contract to a high degree of certainty.</p>\n<h4>Implications of the Qubic&nbsp;project</h4>\n<p>Qubic leverages the IOTA protocol for secure, decentralized communication between the various participants. Additionally, since IOTA has its own built-in payment system, IOTA tokens are used to provide an incentive system for qubic operators. Anyone can decide for themselves at what threshold a reward becomes interesting enough to participate.</p>\n<p>Qubic offers a great incentive for people to run nodes: let others use spare computational power or storage capacity, thus providing a useful service, and get paid to do so. Q-nodes can give new life to old, abandoned PCs, and they can provide traditional cryptocurrency miners with a way of monetizing equipment by doing useful computations instead of solving meaningless (and wasteful) cryptographic puzzles.</p>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*2t41M6BGPX7ASqhd.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Leveraging otherwise-wasteful resources</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Qubic is optimized for the IoT &ndash; low energy consumption and a small memory footprint &ndash; but that does not preclude large-scale computations, especially for computations that may be parallelized and distributed over a large number of processors. In the future, Qubic will leverage the world-wide available, unused computation capacity to solve all kinds of computational problems, all while helping to secure the Tangle: an IOTA-based world supercomputer.</p>\n<h3>The Machine&nbsp;Economy</h3>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*ap8JJWpuuhayvo9s" alt="" /><figcaption>The Machine Economy&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Powered by&nbsp;IOTA</figcaption></figure>\n<p>With Qubic, IOTA Tangle will overcome the limitations of blockchain, to offer a complete technology stack of financial management, distributed computing, distributed artificial intelligence and swarm intelligence, leveraging trustable and immutable data stored in the Tangle as well as gathered from the real world. Let&rsquo;s imagine an economy where: everything will be smart, efficient, autonomous and connected, economically independent and most likely managed by a secure, decentralized technical backbone &ndash;&nbsp;IOTA.</p>\n<p>In the near future, as a consequence, we can expect that a machine will be able to pay its assembly, its maintenance, its energy and also for its liability insurance by giving data, computing power, storage or physical services to other machines. For the first time in history a device will be in a position to earn and spend money on its own. Such is a Machine Economy made possible by&nbsp;Qubic.</p>\n<p>(For more information regarding Qubic, visit: <a href="https://qubic.iota.org/">https://qubic.iota.org/</a>)</p>\n<p><em>IOTA Donations would be much appreciated:</em></p>\n<pre>OEZSSIQJ9IWGHNODFAOQXGYZRBBEQAYTRDFCNWAZSPZILWQO9VYOYSXMQEDGYIURFAWQIIEHZQABDTTAAXFTANN9HD</pre>\n<p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=43da90464797" width="1" height="1" /></p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-iotas-qubic-is-enabling-the-machine-economy-43da90464797">How IOTA&rsquo;s Qubic is Enabling the Machine Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n</p>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-iotas-qubic-is-enabling-the-machine-economy-43da90464797?source=rss-c5b78e27b6c8------2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">How IOTA&rsquo;s Qubic is Enabling the Machine Economy</a> was originally published on <a href="https://medium.com/@Zass27?source=rss-c5b78e27b6c8------2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://medium.com/@Zass27?source=rss-c5b78e27b6c8&#8212;&#8212;2</a>.

The explanations still hold true as the details of Qubic seem to work as I assumed. However, a lot more information has come to light about the implementation details of Qubic. The concepts are very hard to understand, but in this blog, I will try and explain it in an easy to follow way.</p>\n<p><strong>Qubic explained<br /></strong>So far, IOTA is used as a platform for feeless transactions with great scalability. With the introduction of the IOTA Data marketplace, Internet of Things (IoT) devices could start sending data to the Tangle. The data could be purchased by other individuals or devices for applications like machine learning. However, that would all be done outside of the IOTA environment. With the new Qubic release, IOTA can serve as a platform for data gathering, processing and even allow systems to respond to the results, without the need for any servers or third parties. The IOTA Tangle was developed to become a platform for Qubic, which means that Qubic is the big second step in the vision of the IOTA Foundation for IOTA. The new Qubic protocols require a distributed ledger with zero fee transactions and data transfer capabilities, which is what IOTA is today.</p>\n<p>Currently, IoT devices can upload data to the Tangle in data streams. In addition to IoT sensor data, the data on the Tangle could come from external sources like a news feed or even human input like lab observations or bird spotting. All sources of external information are called Oracles. Some Oracles might already compress data from a set of other Oracles, enriching the data and creating a new source of information for applications. The problem with basing decisions on external data sources is the fact that these Oracles have power over your decision making. Therefore, we need to either only use Oracles we trust, or acquire data from multiple Oracles and try to find out what the true data is.</p>\n<p>Finding such a consensus among the Oracles can be done through a smart contract, which is called a Qubic. A Qubic is a piece of code that receives input data and outputs a conclusion. However, the calculation is executed on a set of machines to achieve a truly trustless application. Oracles that execute the Qubic code are called Oracle Machines. The entire set of Oracles that execute the Qubic is called an Assembly. &nbsp;Once 66% of the Assembly comes to the same conclusion, the Quorum (minimum number of agreeing Oracles to reach consensus) is reached and the result of the Qubic is outputted to the Tangle. The result of one Qubic can possibly be fed into another Qubic, triggering the execution of the second Qubic. This allows the creation of a cascade of Qubic function calls that together can resolve complex tasks. Anyone can add to the cascade of Qubics and therefore the Qubics don&rsquo;t require a single owner. For example, a transportation company may have set up a traffic prediction Qubic using a cascade of Qubics to process traffic Oracles. Another party might want to further process the traffic predictions to calculate the best time to do road constructions. They do this by automatically executing their Qubic based on new information received from the traffic prediction Qubic.</p>\n<p>The code for all these Qubics will be written in a completely new programming language called Abra, developed by the IOTA Foundation. Abra is a functional programming language that avoids global states. Given a constant input, every device will output the same values. This is a lot easier to debug and platform agnostic, hopefully preventing costly smart contract issues that have happened before. Abra is made to work optimally with trinary computers. Our next IOTA Deepdive blog will explain why this is important.</p>\n<p><strong>Protection against dishonest Oracles<br /></strong>A Qubic smart contract will only be executed in the Assembly, where other smart contract platforms will execute the code on every node on the network. This is great for scalability and reduces the costs for the creator of the smart contract. However, this does reduce the security as smart contracts use the concept of trust in numbers (more executing nodes = less chance of cheating). Fortunately, the Qubic protocol has several mechanisms to decrease the chances of dishonest or cheating participants who reach a Quorum with incorrect or copied results.</p>\n<p>In my previous blog, I hypothesized that Qubics might be free, due to the nature of feeless transactions on the Tangle. It turns out that execution of Qubics does cost money. Every Oracle that has helped reach Quorum using the accepted truth is paid for participation, while Oracles who were &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; and outputted the wrong result do not get paid. The total costs of executing the Qubic depends on what the creator is willing to offer, and the Assembly can decide if they find the payment sufficient. This is a basic supply and demand model that is also found in blockchain fees. The Oracles collect this fee, which allows anyone with spare hardware to run an Oracle and receive money in exchange for there computational power. In essence, this is like mining, but while actually doing a useful task!</p>\n<p>The creator of the Qubic can choose which Assembly they want to run their Qubic on. The decision will be based on the size and reputation of the Assembly. A bigger Assembly will have more individual Oracles, which decreases the chance of a cheated Quorum result. However, having more participants also requires you to pay more Oracles, thus increase the expenses. The payment of honest Oracles is a great incentive to both run an Oracle and keep it honest. In addition, the Oracle might not be in the same Assembly all the time. An Assembly can change in size based on a vote between Assembly members and this might even give an Assembly the ability to kick out dishonest participants or increase in size to reduce the effect of the known dishonest participants.</p>\n<p>To prevent malicious actors to split their hardware into multiple Oracles within the same Assembly to create more voting power, the Qubic protocol has a resource test. Depending on the Assembly, the resource test will benchmark the hardware of the Oracle by requesting a stress test. For example, to measure computational power, an Oracle must complete as many Proof-of-Work puzzles in a set timeframe. If a malicious actor would run two Oracles on the same hardware, the performance would half for each Oracle. The performance of the Oracles determines the size of their vote to reach a Quorum. Thus, making it irrelevant if a malicious actor has multiple Oracles on the same hardware. Lastly, the system prevents Oracles from copying the results from other Oracles, using a commit and reveal design. All Oracles submit their findings first in the form of a hash of the result and a hash of the result concatenated with a unique random number. This makes copying the results impossible and forces the Oracles to come up with there own answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Business implications<br /></strong>Although the Qubic project has now unveiled its details, we are still far away from a working implementation. The project is the top priority for the fast-growing IOTA Foundation, meaning we will see regular updates. What we do know is that it is going to have a big impact on many industries. Any company which is interested in trustless applications should have a look into IOTA and Qubic. In addition, IOTA and Qubic add a lot of new options for revenue streams. IOTA already allowed businesses to sell their (enriched) data, but with Qubic, companies can set up an Oracle to sell their computational models as well! We could even go a step further and expect the distributed computing to train and improve machine learning models and turn these into profitable Oracles, without the need of high-performance hardware.</p>\n<p>Another technology that might be disrupted is the trend of serverless computation and microservices, which is popular in IoT, as Qubics are very similar. However, Qubics have an inherited feeless payment protocol and are decentralized, therefore removing the influence from the cloud providers. Companies that currently work on any blockchain/DLT use case should reconsider using IOTA for all the advantages. IOTA with Qubic allows free transactions and relatively cheap execution of smart contracts. It is also a fact that IOTA and Qubic both scale and are future proof, allowing companies to prepare for bigger use cases that won&rsquo;t be halted by the limitation of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://vxcompany.com/2018/06/04/iotas-qubic-explained-2/">IOTA&rsquo;s Qubic explained #2<br /></a><span> was originally published on </span><a href="https://vxcompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">vxcompany.com</a><span>.The IOTA-News Community curates, examines, and summarizes news from external services while producing its own original material.

As noted by <em>Finance Magnates</em>, the exchange processes roughly $20 million in cryptocurrency trading per day — with some expecting the cryptocurrency exchange to overtake Indonesia&#8217;s primary stock exchange in terms of users this year.</p>\n<p>The Republic of Indonesia is home to more than 261 million people and thus represents a rather massive market for TRON. However, the use of cryptocurrency is banned in the country — though trading and mining are reportedly still legal.</p>\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">Superior to Ethereum?</h3>\n<p>On May 31, TRON launched its Mainnet during a live stream, which — according to the company — was broadcast to millions of viewers around the world.</p>\n<p>During the live stream, TRON&#8217;s founder, Justin Sun, took the opportunity to boast about his platform&#8217;s supposed advantages over Ethereum.

Now, even the United States are catching up. New York state is planning to establish a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-york-state-legislature-proposes-creation-of-cryptocurrency-task-force">task force</a> to study the implications of digital currencies on the financial markets in New York.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">A few countries like Norway and Switzerland are toying with the idea of launching their own digital currency. Estonia had plans to establish a national cryptocurrency, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/estonia-rolls-back-its-plan-to-issue-national-digital-currency">Estcoin</a> but had to shelve its proposal following an objection from the European Central Bank.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">While the launch of a US-based crypto ETF is still a distant dream, Huobi, the third largest crypto exchange in the world by trade volume has launched an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-huobi-jointly-launches-93-mln-china-south-korea-blockchain-fund">ETF</a>, based on its market index. The world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange, Binance, also announced <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-crypto-exchange-binance-seeks-20-major-partners-for-giant-1-bln-fund">plans</a> to launch a $1 billion fund to invest in crypto startups.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We believe that the globe is moving towards a greater adoption of cryptocurrencies, which should fuel the next leg of the rally. We want to take advantage of the current fall in the crypto markets to establish positions, however, we are waiting for the opportune time to invest. Let&rsquo;s see if we can locate any buy setups today.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">BTC/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> rallied close to the 20-day EMA but could not break out of it. If it doesn&rsquo;t stop at the current levels, it can fall to $7300 and below that it will retest $7100. &nbsp;</p>\n<p dir="ltr">\n<p dir="ltr">The 20-day EMA acts as a resistance in a downtrend and acts as a support in an uptrend. Therefore, until the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=btc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BTC/USD</a> pair breaks out of the 20-day EMA, it will remain negative and susceptible to selling pressure on any rally.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The traders should wait for a dip below $7,000 or a breakout above the 20-day EMA to establish long positions. We don&rsquo;t find any buy setups at the current levels; hence, we suggest traders to remain on the sidelines.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">ETH/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum</a> is trading inside the descending channel, making lower lows and lower highs. The trend will change when the digital currency breaks this streak and makes a higher high and a higher low.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">From the support line of the channel on May 28, the digital currency rallied to the resistance line of the channel on June 03 but the bulls could not break out of the channel; hence, prices have again turned down today. &nbsp;</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="ETH/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/eecac31307446952c81b76f7ff14c599.png" title="ETH/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">If the next dip doesn&rsquo;t break below the intraday low of May 28, it will be a positive sign. We suggest traders to wait for the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=eth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ETH/USD</a> pair to break out and close (UTC time frame) above the descending channel before initiating any long positions.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Conversely, if the digital currency breaks below $492.5, it can again decline to the support line of the channel, close to $464. We didn&rsquo;t find any buy setups at the current levels.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">XRP/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ripple">Ripple</a> bounced off the critical support at $0.56270 and scaled above the 20-day EMA but could not break out of the 50-day SMA. It continues to trade inside a descending triangle, which is a bearish sign. A break below the $0.54 level can extend the fall to $0.45.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="XRP/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/a7f11befcb7b901fdfdbcd599f50f4d1.png" title="XRP/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">The first sign of strength will be when the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=xrp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">XRP/USD</a> pair breaks out of the $0.83 levels. Both moving averages are flattening out, which points to a range-bound action, rather than a trending move.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We shall wait for a couple of days before suggesting any trade on it.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">BCH/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr">We were expecting <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-cash">Bitcoin Cash</a> to trade in a small range but we were proven wrong as it rallied for the past two days and came close to the 50-day SMA.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="BCH/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/c69d9ecb51988598374fa288d0df954a.png" title="BCH/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BCHUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=bch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BCH/USD</a> pair is turning down from just above $1,200 levels. It can take support at the 20-day EMA or at the $1000 levels.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">If either of the supports hold, the bulls will again attempt to break out of the 50-day SMA and rally to $1,400 levels.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We shall wait for the virtual currency to find some support before suggesting any trades.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">EOS/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/eos">EOS</a> spiked after its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-price-jumps-on-news-of-eosio-10-release-50-mln-fund-to-support-ecosystem">EOSIO 1.0 launch</a> and came close to its first target objective of $15.6356, specified in our <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-bitcoin-cash-eos-litecoin-cardano-stellar-iota-price-analysis-june-01">previous</a> analysis. However, we have not recommended any positions because we don&rsquo;t trade during major events due to the high level of uncertainty.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="EOS/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/63b421ef9e66425c2ee7b7fe405366f2.png" title="EOS/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EOSUSD/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EOS/USD</a> pair is witnessing profit taking at higher levels and is likely to retest the breakout levels at $12.9870. The 20-day EMA is also located just above this level.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">If the level holds, the bulls will try to resume the up move towards $18.67 levels once again but if the support breaks, the digital currency will re-enter the range and can slump back to $10.3384 levels.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We shall wait for more clarity to emerge before recommending any trade on it.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">LTC/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/litecoin">Litecoin</a> has turned down from the $127 levels, which is a major resistance. Its downside support is at $115.447, which is the intraday low of May 30. If this level breaks, a slide to $107.102 is possible.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">However, if the level holds, the bulls will again attempt to break out of the overhead resistance.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="LTC/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/203f72a3a74dc47e7395fdc48aa5d0d4.png" title="LTC/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">If the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=ltc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LTC/USD</a> pair breaks out of $127, it can rally to the downtrend line of the descending triangle, close to $150. Therefore, we recommend a long position on a close (UTC time frame) above $127 with a close stop loss.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We recommend to keep the allocation size less than 50 percent of usual for this trade because the digital currency is still trading inside a bearish pattern. The negative setup will be invalidated if the bulls break out of $160.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">ADA/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr">For the past two days, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cardano">Cardano</a> broke above the $0.23 levels on an intraday basis but could not close (UTC time frame) above it. Hence, our buy recommendation <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-bitcoin-cash-eos-litecoin-cardano-stellar-iota-price-analysis-june-01">suggested</a> in the previous analysis did not trigger.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="ADA/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/259c65e18cf3b0cb0f3a9edbde00e3a7.png" title="ADA/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">Currently, the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSDT/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ADA/USD</a> pair has turned down. It has a strong support at the $0.17 levels. If this level breaks, a slide to the bottom of the large range at $0.13 is possible.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, if the bulls stem the current weakness and cause a turnaround, a break out of the $0.23 levels should be positive. The 50-day SMA might act as a minor resistance but we expect this level to be crossed.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Hence, we retain our buy recommendation provided in the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-bitcoin-cash-eos-litecoin-cardano-stellar-iota-price-analysis-june-01">previous</a> analysis.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">XLM/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/stellar">Stellar</a> closed (UTC time frame) above the 20-day EMA by a small margin on June 03, triggering our buy suggestion provided in the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-bitcoin-cash-eos-litecoin-cardano-stellar-iota-price-analysis-june-01">previous</a> analysis.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="XLM/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/559c7644ef99c5b6f5318fd8fe703246.png" title="XLM/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">The bulls failed to build on the gains above the 20-day EMA resulting in a decline below the moving average and the horizontal line today.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The 20-day EMA is flat and the 50-day SMA is also turning flat. This increases the probability of a range formation in the near term.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We shall watch for a couple of days and close the position if the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XLMUSD/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">XLM/USD</a> pair doesn&rsquo;t rise above $0.32.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">On the downside, support is at $0.242 and below that at the $0.184 levels.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">IOTA/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/iota">IOTA</a> broke out of the 50-day SMA on June 03 but could not sustain the higher levels. It turned down from just above $2 levels and is currently taking support at the 20-day EMA. A break of this can extend the decline to $1.63, which is a strong support.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="IOTA/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/56106bd588a999478f5c4add24d6ab09.png" title="IOTA/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">If the bulls successfully defend the $1.63 levels for a couple of days, the traders can consider it as a buying opportunity with the stops below the $1.3 levels.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Long positions should be avoided if the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/IOTUSD/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IOTA/USD</a> pair breaks down of $1.63 because the next support on the downside is at $1.33 and below that at the bottom of the range at $0.9150. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span>The market data is provided by the <a href="https://hitbtc.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HitBTC</a> exchange.

Therefore, we recommend a long position on a close (UTC time frame) above $127 with a close stop loss.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">We recommend to keep the allocation size less than 50 percent of usual for this trade because the digital currency is still trading inside a bearish pattern.

And as cryptocurrency users looking to invest in a new cryptocurrency, we often get to the point where we are not sure when we should invest and what&rsquo;s the best option to put our money in the market.</p>\n<p>Following Ethereum&rsquo;s success as a blockchain platform for growing DApps, decentralized applications, the blockchain space ever so often experiences the emergence of some similar platforms with <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-coinbase-listing-could-happen-soon-five-reasons-why/">EOS</a> being one of them. The Hong Kong-based blockchain, EOS, has been billed as the Ethereum killer. It promises a decentralized application platform (DApp).</p>\n<h3>EOS 101</h3>\n<p>Created by Block.one and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Larimer">Dan Larimer</a>, EOS makes it possible for DApps to scale both vertically and horizontally, and like Ethereum, EOS is a platform that allows other digital coins to come into fruition.</p>\n<p>Its main objective is to answer the problems of speed, scalability, and user experience by providing account recovery, doing away with transaction fees, and alike. The blockchain manages to attain this by using Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.</p>\n<p>Here I will highlight the reasons why EOS is a good investment opportunity.</p>\n<h3>EOS Scalability</h3>\n<p>Blockchain scalability is a real problem especially now when virtual currencies like Bitcoin and <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-tron-erc20-migration-affect-on-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> are competing with more mainstream platforms like MasterCard, <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/paypal-nasdaqpypl-and-verge-xvg-to-partner-soon/">PayPal</a>, and Visa; they seriously need to intensify their performance when it comes to transaction time.</p>\n<p>Although not being a &lsquo;silver bullet&rsquo; to the scalability issue, EOS is built specifically to prioritize scalability performance by ensuring massive adoption of the cryptocurrency is not a problem.</p>\n<p>The EOS platform was built to hold millions of users at the same time making use of its blockchain, but even so, scaling is a continuous problem that has a terrible way of going around any attempts of solving it. As soon as developers improve scalability, products adapt until scalability levels are reached again leading to another performance crisis.</p>\n<h3>Ethereum&rsquo;s (EOS biggest competitor) Current State</h3>\n<p>On several occasions, EOS has been compared to Ethereum with both currencies sharing a similar vision of becoming a decentralized space for trading with cryptocurrencies. However, Ethereum seems to be back peddling away from this vision as it requires a lot of time, work, and resources to implement.</p>\n<p>In the opposite side of the frame, <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-eos-eos-edge-out-bitcoin-cash-bch-after-its-mainnet-launch/">EOS</a> has continued to pursue this vision making it have scalability, and a better-equipped ecosystem that is leading to the platforms become the primary option users.</p>\n<h3>EOS Source of Funds</h3>\n<p>Many of the virtual currencies if not all result in worrying situations when it comes to the facts that relate to funding activities. But thanks to EOS&rsquo;s efforts and success in creating an inflation system that supports the funding of the blockchain, the digital coin can spare users from transaction cost that could have been used to source for funds.</p>\n<p><a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/when-is-the-best-time-to-buy-digital-coins-eos/">EOS</a> relies on a 5% annual inflation that is used to pay block producers and for requests of the whole community.</p>\n<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>\n<p>Holding EOS tokens allows you to use its shared network resources. Meaning you will have access to bandwidth, storage, and many other services after investing in <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-eos-litecoin-top-bets-despite-shaky-crypto-market/">EOS</a>. It&rsquo;s like possessing a digital real estate where the number of digital coins you own provides you with the percentage of space that will be at your disposal.</p>\n<p>It is still too early to predict EOS movements in the future and whether it&rsquo;s going to live up to its expectations. But what can be said is the digital coin has a good team, a grand vision to become great, a successful leader who is an expert in the field, and a lot of potentials. With all this in context, it&rsquo;s easy to understand <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-future-looks-bright-why/">why EOS</a> is a safe and smart investment option at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

As outlined by <em>Trustnodes</em>, it’s highly likely that most of the addresses belong to popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bitfinex, Binance, Upbit, Huobi, Bithumb, and OKEx.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71895" src="http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chess-pix.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="423" srcset="http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chess-pix.jpg 640w, http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chess-pix-300x198.jpg 300w, http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chess-pix-500x330.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>\n<p>The top 100 addresses account for a total of 748,176,831 tokens, which represents 74.82 percent of the total supply. This means that the next 90 addresses outside of the top 10 hold roughly 250 million tokens — or 25 percent of the total lot.</p>\n<p>The top 1,000 addresses hold 858,120,383 (or 85.81 percent) of all tokens, leaving the 900 addresses between 100 and 1,000 with no more than 11 percent of the entire amount.</p>\n<p>The total amount of token holders is 162,930, meaning that those between #1001 and #162,930 account for a little less than 14 percent. Of course, it’s worth pointing out that individuals or entities can hold more than just one address, so that particular number doesn’t necessarily reflect the number of holders. Conversely, individuals may not be involved in the blockchain and participate in <a href="http://bitcoinist.com/eos-heres-know-investing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOS</a> token trading only through exchanges, so the number of address holders can be widely underestimated.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, one thing is certain — almost 50 percent of the total amount of EOS tokens is concentrated within 10 (or potentially less) individuals or entities.</p>\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">Why is This Important?</h3>\n<p>Instead of being run by a limited number of mining pools, <a href="http://bitcoinist.com/eos-moved-115-million-worth-eth-bitfinex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOS</a> is intended to have a group of 21 Block Producers (BP) voted in by the community. Under the Delegated Proof-of-Stake algorithm the network is running, block producers will be creating the blocks of the blockchain and receiving substantial rewards in EOS tokens which are produced by token inflation.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-71558" src="http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_773287933-eos-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="344" srcset="http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_773287933-eos-1024x640.jpg 1024w, http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_773287933-eos-300x188.jpg 300w, http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_773287933-eos-768x480.jpg 768w, http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_773287933-eos-1120x700.jpg 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>\n<p>BPs are supposed to be chosen in democratic elections where each EOS token can be used to vote for up to 30 different BP candidates. Technically, anyone who has obtained EOS tokens can register to become a block producer and be voted in by the community.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned breakdown of the token distribution brings up an alarming concern – 10 addresses, supposedly held by 10 individuals or entities (or even less), hold almost 50 percent of the voting power. According to the <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/eos-block-producer-voting-guide-fba3a5a6efe0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official post</a> describing the mechanics of the BP elections, the quorum needed for the elections to be valid is 15 percent.</p>\n<p>In other words, those 10 addresses have the full potential to seriously impact and even determine the outcome of any potential elections at any given moment — as they’d always constitute a valid quorum.</p>\n<p>Thus, the state of the entire EOS blockchain is likely to be determined by a mere 1,000 address holders, as they account for 85 percent of the total amount of EOS tokens. Given that there are more than 160,000 contributors to the project, arguments can be made regarding the level of democracy supposedly governing the project.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What do you think about EOS concentration of power?

Source: <a title="" href="https://pixabay.com/en/agnes-waters-1770-queensland-168286/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Pixabay</em></a></p>\n<p>According to <a title="" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-03/australias-first-digital-currency-friendly-town/9828306" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Australian Broadcasting Corporation </i>(<i>ABC</i>)</a>, Gordon Christian, a local real estate agent was involved in the cryptocurrency movement. He mentioned to <em>ABC</em> that he won local business’ support to bring the emerging technology to the Queensland town.</p>\n<p><em>ABC</em> reported on June 3, cryptocurrency groups and tourists from <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/?s=japan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japan</a> will visit the Queensland town to aid them with their new cryptocurrency launch campaign.</p>\n<h2>Australian Town Leverages Cryptocurrency Movement to Boost Tourism</h2>\n<p>Christian initially explored digital currencies when his client asked him about processing <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/news/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin</a> payments from customers. When he realized that the Brisbane airport was accepting digital currency payments, he “thought, this is something worth having a look at.”</p>\n<p>The local real estate agent managed to gain the support of over 2,000 permanent residents to explore cryptocurrencies. “We started from the ground up, shared it with a couple of businesses, and they were straight on board… I guess they were international travelers themselves and had heard of these types of payments,” said Christian. “Initially, we had a good ten businesses that just said, &#8216;Fine let’s go for it.&#8217;”</p>\n<p>The idea to attract the “<a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-travel-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital traveler</a>” quickly took off within the community. “So it started out as, well how would they get here? Could we provide a shuttle service to bring them from the airport or the railway station? Then [we considered], Where would they stay and what are they going to do when they get here?”</p>\n<p>Christian added that 31 businesses from the Queensland town have signed up. These companies range from backpackers to resorts, tour companies, the local pub, restaurants, and even day spas.</p>\n<h3>TravelbyBit Helps Companies Looking to Utilize Cryptocurrency</h3>\n<p>Over time, there have been more brick and mortar retailers across Australia looking to accept digital currencies as a form of payment.</p>\n<p>Queensland startup TravelbyBit is aiding this new financial frontier by launching a point-of-sale application that helps businesses accept cryptocurrency payments. Just last week, the startup rolled out its cryptocurrency payment system at <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/brisbane-airport-start-accepting-bitcoin-payments-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brisbane airport</a>, making Brisbane “Australia’s first digital currency-friendly airport.”</p>\n<p>“If you travel around the world you have to deal with multiple currencies, the exchange rate can be confusing, sometimes you struggle to find ATMs, and sometimes you get swindled by money changers,” said Caleb Yeoh, TravelbyBit’s CEO. “Travelling with one global currency like bitcoin&#8230;makes sense. <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/news/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blockchain</a> has the ability to make transactions a lot more transparent and efficient&#8230;I think it’s the way of the future.”</p>\n<p>Yeoh added that “the town has made a very strategic move trying to appeal to a niche market to take perhaps some of those tourists…to come out to their little part of the woods. People who use <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/cryptocyclopedia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a>&#8230;it’s a social movement, and they believe in it, and therefore they support places&#8230;who take it. So they would come to a place like this just because it takes digital currency.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com/the-australian-beach-town-where-you-can-pay-for-your-holiday-in-bitcoin/">The Australian Beach Town Where You Can Pay for Your Holiday in Bitcoin</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com">BTCMANAGER</a>.</p>',

        content: '<span class="entry-content"><p>The co-founder of Apple strongly believes in Bitcoin as being distinct from the rest of the altcoin space. According to Steve Wozniak, of the 1,500 cryptocurrencies in existence, only Bitcoin can be considered &#8216;pure.&#8217;</p>\n<h2>Wozniak Hopes for Bitcoin to Become a Single Global Currency</h2>\n<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-global-currency.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">CNBC</a> on Monday, Wozniak stated that he hopes Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey&#8217;s belief in Bitcoin will come true. The Apple co-founder made the following comments at the Money 2020 conference being held this week in Amsterdam:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it&#8217;s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wozniak was referring to Dorsey&#8217;s comments back in March of this year. The founder and CEO of both Twitter and Square <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/03/21/twitter-ceo-believes-bitcoin-will-emerge-single-currency-whole-world/" data-wpel-link="internal">stated</a> that he felt that a single currency would emerge for the internet and the world. He went on to state that this currency would be Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>According to the article in CNBC today, Wozniak had bought Bitcoin when each was around $700. He&#8217;d since sold all but one. However, even someone as technically capable as the co-founder of Apple was a still able to fall victim to a scam. He was <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/02/27/steve-wozniak-i-had-seven-bitcoins-stolen-from-me-through-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal">defrauded</a> out of a quantity of the digital currency when exchanging them back to dollars. In addition to his single Bitcoin, he also holds two Ether coins &#8211; the native currency on the Ethereum network.</p>\n<p>In the interview today, Wozniak sang the praises of Bitcoin more astutely than many commentators are capable of. He spoke fondly of its qualities of decentralisation and limited supply, likening it to a natural phenomenon that doesn&#8217;t require human intervention to work:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there&#8217;s a way it&#8217;s distributed… and it&#8217;s pure and there&#8217;s no human running, there&#8217;s no company running and it&#8217;s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Finally, Wozniak addressed the altcoin space . He claimed none could ultimately compete with Bitcoin since each must serve the company that created it. Again, the topic of decentralisation was raised in his assessment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That&#8217;s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<pre>Featured image from Shutterstock.</pre>\n</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/04/steve-wozniak-only-bitcoin-is-pure-digital-gold/" data-wpel-link="internal">Steve Wozniak: &#8216;Only Bitcoin is Pure Digital Gold&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com" data-wpel-link="internal">NewsBTC</a>.</p>',

Szczepanik has been named Senior Advisor for Digital Assets, as well as Associate Director of the Division of Corporation Finance. She will be tasked with &ldquo;coordinat[ing] efforts across all SEC Divisions and Offices regarding the application of U.S. securities laws to emerging digital asset technologies and innovations, including <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ico">Initial Coin Offerings</a> (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Formerly the head of the SEC&rsquo;s distributed ledger group, Szczepanik recently participated in the Consensus blockchain conference in New York, and was <a  href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-blockchain-idUSKBN18K05Q" rel="nofollow,noopener"  target="_blank">quoted</a> as saying that &ldquo;if you want [the crypto] industry to flourish, protection of investors should be at the forefront.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">In her official statement today, Szczepanik struck a similar note, saying she would use the new role &ldquo;to facilitate capital formation, promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and protect investors, particularly Main Street investors.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">In his response to today&rsquo;s appointment, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said that Szczepanik was &ldquo;the right person to coordinate our efforts in this dynamic area that has both promise and risk.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The SEC considers <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-cftc-irs-and-others-a-guide-to-us-regulating-bodies">cryptocurrencies to be securities</a>, which brings them under the purview of its jurisdiction. According to the 70 year old <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ico-goes-extra-mile-to-protect-contributors">Howey Test</a>, a security involves the investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others&#39; efforts.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">During February&rsquo;s US SEC and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cftc">CFTC</a> senate <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-and-cftc-hearing-more-legitimate-icos-or-if-there-was-no-bitcoin-there-would-be-no-blockchain">hearing</a>, Chairman Clayton stressed that while every ICO token the SEC has seen so far is considered a security, a distinction should be made between tokens and major cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum</a>. The latter has reportedly <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wsj-eth-now-in-a-gray-zone-but-2014-ico-was-likely-an-illegal-securities-sale">been a subject</a> of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-foundation-extremely-comfortable-eth-is-not-a-security-co-founder-lubin-says">debate</a> among US regulators, some of whom contend that Ethereum is a security. Were such a determination to be made, its 2014 ICO would constitute an unregistered security offering.</p>\n\n<p>The SEC continues to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-ico-market-is-example-of-unregulated-securities-market-says-sec-commissioner">raise concerns about ICOs</a>, conducting a <a  href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-launches-cryptocurrency-probe-1519856266?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1" rel="nofollow,noopener"  target="_blank">sweeping probe</a> in February 2018, in which it issued subpoenas to force the closure of a number of &ldquo;unregistered securities&rdquo; in the ICO space. Most recently, the organization has concentrated its efforts on educating investors about potential risks, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-launches-mock-ico-to-show-investors-warning-signs-of-fraud">creating</a> a website for a fake ICO that was designed to imitate the classic &ldquo;red flags&rdquo; of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-ico-market-is-example-of-unregulated-securities-market-says-sec-commissioner">fraudulent</a> token sales.</p>\n</p>',

Source: <a title="" href="https://aeonminingpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>aeonminingpool</i></a></p>\n<p>But the fork looks to be successful for now, with blocks still being mined and no chain re-organizations as of yet. The chart above shows how the network hashrate has declined massively from around 140MH/s to a low near 1MH/s and recovered slightly to 10 MH/s at the time of writing as more miners come back online and take advantage of the more favorable profitability. By June 5, the difficulty should have stopped fluctuating so much and blocks should be mined on a more even basis.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the coins that are not widely used on exchanges, like AEON, are relatively safe from these 51 percent attacks we have seen like on <a title="" href="https://twitter.com/zencashofficial/status/1003275809149288450" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZenCash</a>. On the other hand, Electroneum is mining empty blocks after forking, and at one point, there were concerns that <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/8ewgla/en_update_scheduled_for_may_30th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if AEON forked after Electroneum</a>, the former would be more vulnerable to ASICs and malicious attacks as both use a similar algorithm (CryptoNight).</p>\n<h2>‘Sophia’ Release: Just in Time</h2>\n<p>In early May, Katiecharm, one of the figures instrumental behind the rebase of AEON and reviving momentum in the coin, <a title="" href="https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9085162" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that the altcoin is a possible target for a 51 percent attack:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“Yes, Aeon is under high threat of 51 percent in general. If there is enough of a financial incentive out there, then it will happen. We can&#8217;t just hope it doesn&#8217;t.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The state of affairs was depressing for many AEON holders with no definite deadline initially. The negative sentiment was <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/8hp6wx/whatever_happened_to_the_aeon_roadmap/dyljavb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made clear by one miner</a> during the wait for the upgrade to nullify ASICs, “Blindly waiting for the developers to drop some info on us is tiring and frustrating, especially when mining has lost its incentive. I’ll keep mining, hoping the rebase happens and we get rid of those asics but if nothing changes I’ll probably find something else to mine.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the concerns about ASICs did not fall on deaf ears, and on May 24, a new client was released named ‘<a title="" href="https://github.com/aeonix/aeon-gui/releases/tag/v0.12.0.0-aeon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophia</a>,’ which implemented the rebase and set the stage for the June 3 fork to nullify ASICs.</p>\n<p>The June 3 fork of AEON, which included a difficulty reset to mitigate the large reduction in hashrate expected, has galvanized the community and improved sentiment. The time needed for careful and meticulous testing of the new software had a handful of miners and community members worried, but the developers pulled through in the end, with help from Monero developers stoffu and moneromoo.</p>\n<p>On June 4, it is clear that miners are beginning to return, as evidenced by a positive <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/8ofa7g/look_at_the_hashrate_drop_yes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit post</a> celebrating the fork and the increasing hashrate following June 3, as displayed previously.</p>\n<p>Despite the difficulties faced, namely project management and communication with the community, the developers delivered. Despite the success, the events that transpired go to show how coordination problems can cause problems for decentralized projects.</p>\n<p>During the past couple months, the community was tense, and some members even questioned smooth’s and developer&#8217;s intentions, but it seems the trust in them has been well placed; but trusting or relying on someone is something that the AEON community does not want to engage in again.</p>\n<h3>What Doesn’t Kill a Project Makes it Stronger?</h3>\n<p>The series of events did reveal at least one flaw in the decentralized project; being too reliant on one, two or a handful of actors. While the developers delivered, some in the AEON community raised concerns as to what would be the path forward if smooth were to disappear suddenly, or something bad happened to the developer.</p>\n<p>For instance, aeonminingpool <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/8jpngh/logs_irc_meeting_tuesday_may_15th_2018_2pm_pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> their concern in a meeting on May 15, “Smooth &#8211; it&#8217;s best more individuals have access [to the GitHub repo] just for good governance. Nothing more and nothing personal said or implied. You can nominate people whom you deem reliable as well. No one would object I&#8217;m sure.” Katiecharm replied that the community should discuss this topic and smooth approved of the request, that is opening up access to the GitHub repo, so it is not accessible to just one person.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, one Reddit user stated in response to the announcement of ‘Sophia’ &#8211; the software client that would be compatible with the tweaked CryptoNight-lite ASIC resistant algorithm &#8211; that his vocal, long-running concerns about long block times, as experienced by <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/moneros-scheduled-upgrade-to-soon-reveal-the-extent-of-secretive-asic-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monero in April</a>, were ignored initially. The user went onto state how AEON can improve:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“If we can have a more open and expansive view of the crypto marketplace I am sure similar problems will be seen and addressed in a more timely and effective manner.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More frequent communication and better organization is needed for the project to remain relevant and reach its true potential, where developer meetings held on a regular basis were highlighted as one positive step forward. With one major update behind AEON and miners in a better position to mine the <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/news/altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">altcoin</a> profitably, things are looking up, and the path forward now must be forged to inspire confidence in the project.</p>\n<p>With more exchange listings, an aeon pool league, initiatives to incentivize solo mining <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/7n3ycf/aeon_social_roadmap_v01_december_17_edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the agenda since December 2017</a>, as well as improving exposure and merchant adoption, the AEON project is now set to make some solid progress toward these objectives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>Disclaimer: The author has a small holding of AEON, as well as other altcoins.

        title: 'EOS is not decentralized? 50% of EOS tokens belong to top 10 holders',
        content: '<p>Recent data crunching discovered that 50% of the EOS tokens belonged to the top 10 wallets. This questions the apparent decentralization that the token boasts.</p>\n<p>The data in question was uncovered by user Lannisan on Reddit. The post titled &ldquo;EOS Rich List/Genesis Snapshot Statistics&rdquo; crunched the numbers associated with the genesis snapshot results. There was also a disclaimer along with the post that pointed out that some of the bigger wallets may belong to exchanges, but the data still holds disturbing conclusions.</p>\n<p>He went on to state the criteria to enter the top 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 richest EOS holders. The tokens to be held are 20.6 million, 646 thousand, 42 thousand, 3000 and 55 respectively.</p>\n<p>After the data was processed, it turned out that the top 10 held a whopping 496 million tokens of the 1 billion tokens in existence. This is reflective of real world wealth distribution, where 1% of individuals possess 40% of the wealth. The company behind the EOS platform, Block.one holds 10% of all tokens in existence, which left the data excluding Block.one at 39.6% of all tokens held by the top 10.</p>\n<p>The top 100 held 64.82% of all the tokens, which is still a sizeable margin over the top 10. The margin comes up to 25.22%. The top 1000 were abysmal by comparison held over only 75.81%. This translates to a margin of just under 11%. The remaining holders hold only 13.86% of all available. The remaining 0.33% are left unregistered.</p>\n<p>The final break up comes up to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Block.one &#8211; 10%.</li>\n<li>2-1000 &#8211; 75.81%.</li>\n<li>1001-163,920 &#8211; 13.86%.</li>\n<li>Unregistered &#8211; 0.33%.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>He ended the post with:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those Top 1000 holders are quite powerful indeed. The Top 10 alone can almost do whatever they want if all 10 of them agree to do the same thing since they control almost 50% of the total EOS (and no one would be able to stop them). And whoever is in the Top 1000 will also have a lot of influence.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Commenters speculated that the top wallets might not be exchanges, but instead shadow accounts of Dan Larimer.</p>\n<p>User XRballer said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not all exchanges. Several are Dan and his father&#8217;s shadow accounts. They have been buying EOS with ICO Eth all year and storing it in a collection of 100s of wallets. They need to keep majority control over the supply to prevent other cartels from taking over.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>User gallge said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This should simply read YOU ARE F****D.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com/eos-not-decentralized-50-eos-tokens-belong-top-10-holders/">EOS is not decentralized? 50% of EOS tokens belong to top 10 holders</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com">AMBCrypto</a>.</p>',

        content: '<p>Blockchain technology continues to adapt and evolve to suit the demands of its growing user base.  From the original Bitcoin protocols, it has evolved into the 2nd generation Ethereum platform, and today we are in the process of building the 3rd generation of blockchains. The technology has progressed from a simple distributed database into a more powerful distributed based computer. But where is it going?</p>\n<p>The first blockchain was thought up in 2008 by the anonymous developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto. This technology gave Bitcoin its engine, which became the first digital currency to solve the problems associated with requiring a central server, or trusted authority, to regulate the transactions.</p>\n<p>Since then it has been recognized that the distributed ledger technology can have many uses beyond digital currencies and can be used for tracking and recording the trade of anything valuable.  The Bitcoin design has been inspirational, acting as a large-scale proof of concept.</p>\n<h2><strong>Second Generation Blockchain</strong></h2>\n<p>Within just a few years of the genesis of blockchain technology, there was an evolutionary jump as the 2nd generation emerged. This 2nd gen technology was designed as a network for developers to build applications on. This is where the evolution of the technology allowed blockchain to become a distributed virtual computer, which was made possible by the developments associated with the Ethereum platform which is an open source, public blockchain distributed computer platform featuring smart contract functionality.</p>\n<p>This new virtual machine, which went live in 2015, runs computer programs using a global network of computers. The goal of this technology was for the express purpose of building distributed applications. So far, the system has been very successful at getting the attention of a large and growing community of developers, supporters, and enterprises who continue to push the evolution and development of this new technology.</p>\n<p>The most important contribution of this system, as the second generation of blockchain technology, is that it has brought the system up from being primarily used as relatively simple distributed database used as the platform for Bitcoin, to a much more evolved and useful distributed computing platform designed for running decentralized applications and smart contracts.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5179" src="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1.png" alt="blockchain revolution" width="1000" height="493" srcset="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1.png 1000w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-300x148.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-768x379.png 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-550x271.png 550w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-520x256.png 520w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-625x308.png 625w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-15x7.png 15w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-999x493.png 999w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-854x421.png 854w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>\n<p>Right now, Ethereum is the most popular and viable platform for building applications on.  Many types of applications have been built on this foundation already, from popular social networks to financial applications.</p>\n<p>Ethereum has been a major step forward, and with its success has given us a look into the future of what is possible to achieve with blockchain.  It seems that this technology will soon become a massive, globally distributed cloud computing platform for which we will be able to run applications of any type, and at the same scale and speed as today’s major websites.  All with the security assurances of today’s blockchains.</p>\n<p>However, right now these new platforms are more like extremely inefficient computers that don’t do much except proving concepts. Getting to the next link in the evolutionary chain will involve some serious mathematical problem solving not for the faint of heart.  The ability to handle high volume transactional workloads remain at the heart of the problem and what this 3<sup>rd</sup> generation of blockchains are currently trying to solve.</p>\n<p>Keeping the transaction ledgers current to support Bitcoin transactions uses more energy than some small countries.  Currently, the consumption of power equals that of Denmark, and costs over a billion and a half dollars a year.  Most of this consumption is being fueled by cheap, dirty, energy sources in China, which is where about 60% of the transaction mining happens. Using this much energy is simply not viable for obvious reasons, especially as these networks continue to grow.</p>\n<p>Technical wizardry and monetary incentives to maintain the accuracy and records of who owns what, without a centralized authority controlling the whole thing is how it’s done today.  The problem is that it’s difficult to maintain this balancing act while also trying to grow the number of users using the system. Currently, blockchain requires a global consensus on the order and outcome of all transfers, which is what gives the technology its unique ability to police itself with high assurances of accuracy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Transactions</strong></h2>\n<p>In Ethereum, all transactions are stored publicly on every node of the blockchain, which has its downside as well as its upside. The downside is that performance slows down because every computer handling transactions has to calculate all of them in real time. The reason for this is that it is clearly a cumbersome task that sees the total number of transactions increasing every 10 to 12 seconds with each new block added.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5180" src="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume.png" alt="bitcoin volume" width="1000" height="602" srcset="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume.png 1000w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-300x181.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-768x462.png 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-550x331.png 550w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-520x313.png 520w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-625x376.png 625w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-15x9.png 15w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-999x602.png 999w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-854x514.png 854w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>\n<p>The volume of transactions is also an existing constraint of the system.  With cryptocurrency, transaction speed is calculated by measuring the number of transactions per second that can be handled. The Bitcoin network’s capacity, theoretically, is somewhere around seven transactions per second, while Ethereum blockchains run about twice as many.</p>\n<p>Comparatively, a credit card network is typically able to handle over 20,000 transactions per second. Facebook, might have about close to a million users on their site at any given moment, can handle about 175,000 requests for action per second.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cost</strong></h2>\n<p>Another major issue is that this is all pretty expensive.  The fact is that it costs a good deal of coins to pay the data miners for maintaining the ledger, and the system we have now is only ok for a limited amount of large transactions. However, using the blockchain to make small purchases, like a cup of coffee at Starbucks would currently not be possible, because, in their current form, they simply can’t handle a large number of small transactions such as what would be needed to handle high-volume exchanges like what you would find typically at most places like grocery stores, restaurants, and coffee shops.</p>\n<p>Attempting these types of transactions would be, under the current system, entirely too expensive.  Looking into the future, it is easy to see how people will want to use the blockchain for these types of transactions.  Currently under development, many different companies are now laboring to put together a next-generation blockchain infrastructure, with each organization experimenting with different methods to try and eliminate existing problems with the system.</p>\n<h2><strong>Moving Blockchain Into the Future</strong></h2>\n<p>One of these networks is the Lightning Network, which is trying to extend the capacity of existing blockchains.  Their idea is that small, insignificant transactions, like your cup of coffee, will not have to be stored on the main blockchain, which is known as an “off-chain” approach. It works by creating small subnetworks where many smaller transactions can take place without each of those transactions needing to be recorded on the main ledger. A payment network channel is opened up between a group of people. The money the network represents is then frozen on the main blockchain.  Those members can then transact with one another using their private keys to validate their transactions.</p>\n<p>This is a bit like having a bar tab, and the exchanges are marked down without making a log on the main blockchain, and then, at a designated point, the sum of those transactions is logged and the ledger is updated.  This only requires a couple transactions on the main ledger.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5181" src="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology.png" alt="blockchain technology" width="1000" height="579" srcset="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology.png 1000w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-300x174.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-768x445.png 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-550x318.png 550w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-520x301.png 520w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-625x362.png 625w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-15x9.png 15w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-999x579.png 999w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-854x494.png 854w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>\n<p>This makes much less work to maintain the main blockchain and allows for the ability to handle many small transactions within the subnetworks.  As of the start of this year, there is a beta system running live on the Bitcoin test net, but the system will not be ready for a little while yet.</p>\n<p>IOTA is another example of a beta system where existing blockchains are able to handle a high volume of transactions by using parallel operations, with the data structure acting more like a network than a linear chain. With this system structure, the processing and validation can happen right alongside each other.</p>\n<p>The difference with this system is that there are no specialized miners in the network because every node that uses this network does the same work.  In this system, every node making a transaction also works to form a consensus. The diffusion of mining activities within these networks is what eliminates those bottlenecks that slow the whole thing down and demands tons of energy.</p>\n<p>Also, with this network, there are no transaction fees for validation, and because this system is user-generated, the more people that use the network the faster it becomes.  This is the complete opposite of existing systems today, making IOTA very scalable.</p>\n<p>These are only two of the ideas being explored today to make the 3rd generation of blockchain technology useable for tomorrow&#8217;s demand.  As you can see, the blockchain is an emerging technology, and, as it expands and evolves, its applications could be endless.  If everything continues to grow as it has since the beginning, <a href="https://cryptoinvestinginsider.com/">investing in blockchain</a> would be a smart decision. The advancement of this technology could, and most probably will evolve into a globally distributed computer system that will change everything.  Just as the light bulb changed the world in 1879, so could blockchain technology if only we continue to find viable solutions that allow it to grow.</p>\n<p><em><strong>About the author:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Chris Douthit<br />\n@chris_douthit</p>\n<p>Chris Douthit is a stock and cryptocurrency analyst who’s worked in both finance and technology for nearly 20 years.

In a tweet to the community, the IOTA team announced that project Qubic will enable IOTA gain unlimited use cases, and turn IOTA into one stop solution. The tweet read as follows,</p>\n</p>\n<p>So why is this a big deal for IOTA (MIOTA) investors? Well, IOTA (MIOTA) is one of the strongest crypto projects in the market, because it is everything that most blockchains can only wish for. &nbsp;For instance, while bitcoin and most other cryptos struggle with issues like transaction costs and scalability, IOTA (MIOTA) offers feeless transactions at unrivalled speeds. That&rsquo;s why it has constantly been labelled as the blockchain killer. This also explains why it is getting adopted in futuristic projects that will define the 21<sup>st</sup> century. For instance, it was adopted by Taipei city in the development of a futuristic smart city. It has seen adoption in the smart car industry in the recharging of electric cars. That&rsquo;s huge and points to the potential of IOTA (MIOTA) to become an integral part of the 21<sup>st</sup> digital economy.</p>\n<p>Now with Qubic, IOTA is taking the game a notch higher, by acquiring smart contracts capabilities.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because it will have the same capabilities as Ethereum and all other smart contract blockchains in the market. However, it has one edge over them all, and that&rsquo;s the fact that it is faster, cheaper and more scalable than them all. At the moment, Ethereum is struggling with scalability and transaction speeds, which is a major hindrance for its mass adoption. With Qubic, IOTA (MIOTA) now has the capacity to offer the same smart contracts capabilities, but in an infinitely scalable environment that is also superfast and feeless. There is absolutely no reason why Dapps developers would choose Ethereum, NEO or any of the other platform blockchains in the market, when they can get a way better deal with IOTA (MIOTA).</p>\n<p>In essence, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before IOTA (MIOTA) takes over, not just the digital payments economy and dethrone the likes of bitcoin and Litecoin, but the Dapps smart economy as well.</p>\n<p>With such huge and endless possibilities, why isn&rsquo;t IOTA (MIOTA) shooting up? If anything, it has dropped in value since the announcement was made! Well first, there is an element of profit-taking to it.&nbsp; While project Qubic has been in the works for years, the IOTA (MIOTA) team first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOM_SCCblrA">revealed it about a month ago</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, the community has been eagerly waiting for it, and this led to a surge in price all through the month. That&rsquo;s why when the news finally came out, there was a sell off. It&rsquo;s a classic case of buying the rumor and selling the news.&nbsp; Second, the entire crypto market has started the week low, after the ZenCash <a href="https://cryptorecorder.com/?s=51%25">51% attack</a>. This has affected the short-term value of IOTA (MIOTA).</p>\n<p>The good thing is that these are short-term issues that have no bearing on the future of IOTA (MIOTA).&nbsp; Once developers start creating smart contracts on IOTA, it will be huge! It could even go higher than $10 this year. Invest in IOTA (MIOTA) with a long-term view.</p>\n<div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled">\n<div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing"></div>\n</div>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://cryptorecorder.com/2018/06/04/iota-miota-project-qubic-makes-10-possible-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IOTA (MIOTA) &ndash; Project Qubic makes $10 possible in 2018</a> was originally published on <a href="https://cryptorecorder.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cryptorecorder.com/</a>.

According to the company&rsquo;s website, the app is currently under beta testing and will be available for download in Q2 2018.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Smart contracts and shared space capacity</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">&quot;Triwer has built in a number of unique selling points which we believe will make Triwer an industry online standard in much the same way as Uber in the private taxi sector or AirBnB in short term property rentals&quot;, Triwer&#39;s white paper says.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The core idea of the Triwer App is that it will automatically select the most appropriate and best value delivery route, including multi-carrier options by means of a multi-party smart contract. In particular, such a smart contract may include insurance and will be recorded on the main blockchain but with constituent parts, processes and obligations transferred to a sidechain.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain</a> management platform will allow smart contracting, delivery management, tracking, escrow and payment. According to the project&rsquo;s &nbsp;white paper, the smart contract will unify tracking across the sidechain, as the package is booked in and out of key waypoints and transfers between carriers, until the final mile delivery is ready for dispatch through a Triwer crowd delivery driver. Upon confirmation of receipt the contract is concluded, the completion is recorded on the main blockchain, and payment distributed to each constituent of the contract.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">One of the project&#39;s features is sharing spare capacity and using resources that are already making a similar journey and improving efficiency. According to Triwer team, that scheme will reduce emission on duplicated journeys, and eventually will have significant effect on traffic congestion.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Sales will focus on signing up small to medium sized e-commerce sites and attracting their customers to install the Triwer app through various promotions and incentives in order to channel deliveries through the Triwer network, says the white paper.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Conquering the market</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">According to the project&#39;s white paper, Triwer aims to take a significant share of the European courier express and parcel market through acceptance of its automated DLT (distributed leger technology) platform and TRW token.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;All transactions with the main or side blockchain must be electronic and hence Triwer&rsquo;s encrypted electronic token the TRW will be the operating currency across the platform&rdquo;, says the text of the paper. Triwer will organize wallets for all main counter-parties and stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The app will also incorporate an automated exchange application, such as &lsquo;Coinify&rsquo;, that automatically transfers fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies into TRW to transact along the smart contract.</p>\n\n<p>Triwer has launched its crowdfunding campaign on June 1, 2018. The public token sale will remain open until June 30, 2018. The soft cap is $5 mln, and the hard cap is $25 mln. 1 TRW coin equals to $0.08.

        content: '<span class="entry-content"><p>Online searches for Bitcoin on Google Trends have taken a hit following a drop in market prices since the beginning of the year.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin Searches Take a Nosedive</h2>\n<p>Figures from Google Trends don&#8217;t paint a pretty picture. Mid-December searches for Bitcoin were recorded at 100 out of a scale of 100. However, fast-forward six months later and Google Trends show that number at 10, a drop of 90 percent. From January, when results were pegged at 44, the decline in interest is over 75 percent.</p>\n<p>Notably, the results highlight that this time last year low figures for Bitcoin searches were recorded in June as well.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-334727 size-full" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/04191500/Google-Trends.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="541" /></p>\n<p>According to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, this drop in interest is not a good sign for crypto prices, reports <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/google-searches-for-bitcoin-nosedive-75-percent-this-year.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">CNBC</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We use Google Trends to track search queries for &#8216;bitcoin&#8217; as a proxy for potential new buyers,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since the beginning of the year the number one digital currency has dropped in value by over 55 percent, and is currently trading at over $7,500, according to CoinMarketCap. Interestingly, while Colas admits that the company loves the idea of the cryptocurrency, he adds that his team are not fans of purchasing it at current levels.</p>\n<p>Others, however, think that now is the perfect time to invest in the market.</p>\n<p>Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital Management, a hedge fund company focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, was reported at the beginning of the month as saying that Bitcoin&#8217;s value may have reached a bottom, and that now is the time to buy.</p>\n<p>The founder of the San Francisco-based company said on CNBC&#8217;s &#8216;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/buy-bitcoin-now-while-its-still-cheap-says-cryptocurrency-investor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Fast Money</a>&#8216; that &#8216;all cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now. It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.&#8217; Back in April, Morehead also said that the worst could be over for the digital currency. He said then that was a good time to purchase Bitcoin, calling it a &#8216;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/27/pantera-fund-ceo-calls-bitcoin-screaming-buy-highly-optimsitic/" data-wpel-link="internal">screaming buy</a>&#8216; when it was valued around $6,600.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just Bitcoin, though, that is feeling the brunt of disinterestedness from potential new traders. Google searches for other major cryptocurrencies have also declined. Ethereum is down by 85 percent since the beginning of the year; Ripple has dropped by 91 percent; and Bitcoin Cash has experienced a decline of 80 percent.</p>\n<pre>Featured image from Shutterstock.</pre>\n</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/04/bitcoin-interest-drops-90-percent-from-december-google-trends/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin Interest Drops 90 Percent from December, Google Trends</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com" data-wpel-link="internal">NewsBTC</a>.</p>',

Zhang did not predict when such a bubble burst may occur. She said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bubble">bubble</a> to break. We still see a lot of hype in the market, valuations are high and unreasonable. We really think if the bubble bursts, it&rsquo;s a good thing for the industry.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Additionally, Zhang said that she is helping Binance to deal with the scams that have emerged as a result of the hype, with so-called Cryptocurrency Governance Initiatives, or CGI. The purpose of the initiative is to &ldquo;fight scams and sh*t coins, and to boost crypto and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain technology</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Within the initiative, Binance will reportedly support funds and token teams it&rsquo;s working with, but &nbsp;they must promise that &quot;they won&rsquo;t participate in pump and dump&quot; schemes, and that they will build products according to their white papers. Binance will stop investing in funds and delist tokens from teams that do not honor their commitments.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Over the next three to five years, Binance Labs <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-crypto-exchange-binance-seeks-20-major-partners-for-giant-1-bln-fund">plans to invest</a> $1 bln of Binance profits in various projects, with an average investment per project between $1 mln and $10 mln. There are 20 different cryptocurrency funds with whom Binance plans to collaborate as part of the new venture capital fund. All the projects involved will be obligated to join CGI. The fund has reportedly made four investments in both companies&rsquo; tokens and equity so far.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Zhang, who was previously an investment director at venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, believes there can be a conflict between investing in tokens and equity, as they are valued differently. She said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;If we see founders contribute to both sides, we&rsquo;ll hold both sides. Sometime it&rsquo;s hard to see which one is more valuable, but our position is to support the founders and create value for the project as a whole.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ella Zhang is not the first expert to predict a bubble burst. In April, Nobel Prize laureate for economics Robert Shiller <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nobel-winning-economist-shiller-says-bitcoin-bubble-may-be-around-for-a-while">pointed out that</a> while <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> might be a bubble, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it will burst and be gone forever. According to Shiller, there is a part of the cryptocurrency &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; that is political, as people who don&rsquo;t trust their governments may be tempted to invest.</p>\n</p>',

Otherwise, ideal entries for cautious traders should be above $650.</p>\n<h2>From the News</h2>\n<p>We cannot refute Ethereum possibilities. It did not only allow for wholesale tokenization but with smart contract, there is innovation and creation of new opportunities. While this has been revolutionizing, the limitation of throughput has been a major concern. A slow throughput inevitably leads to network congestion as more people utilize this platform. As it is Ethereum can handle a maximum of 15 TPS meaning it cannot compete with other networks as Tron who promises high throughput up-to 10,000 TPS for their DApp developers. This is the exact reason why Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum developers are hard at work searching for scaling and throughput solutions.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Ethereum</a> will eventually be able to process 1 million transactions per second and possibly more than 100 million per sec with second-layer solutions such as <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sharding?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Sharding</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Plasma?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Plasma</a>. This was revealed by Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, in a recent session with OmiseGo AMA <a href="https://t.co/asktsXuxx2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/asktsXuxx2</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; boxmining (@boxmining) <a href="https://twitter.com/boxmining/status/1003667882532892673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 4, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>So far, we have two proposals that are already in development: Sharding and Plasma. Hopefully, implementation of these two could lift all the Ethereum congestion and scalability problems. Sharding will deal with network congestion and proposes the splitting of the Ethereum network nodes into portions called shards. Each shard would handle certain transactions meaning on a quadratic proportion, the network can process thousands if not hundreds of thousands of transaction concurrently through these individual shards. This way, individual nodes won’t have to process each and every transaction that passes through its network as it is the case at the moment.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Plasma would specifically deal with network scalability. It has been a thorny issue and what most want to see is an infinitely scaling network. Plasma would be what Vitalik refers to as a second layer solution that entirely depends on the Ethereum blockchain solely for security. It do share some similarities with LN as both are off chain layers.</p>\n<h2>Ethereum Price Technical Analysis</h2>\n<h4>Weekly Chart</h4>\n<div id="attachment_334693" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-334693" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/04173253/Ethereum-Weekly-Chart-for-June-5.png" alt="Ethereum (ETH) Price Technical Analysis" width="1280" height="1024" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><strong><em>Ethereum Weekly Chart by Trading View</em></strong></a></p></div>\n<p>From a 6 month angle, we can say <a href="https://www.theglobalmail.org/btc-xrp-eth-bch-neo-price-analysis-june-4/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Ethereum prices are on a down trend</a>. And we cannot be further from the truth when we place a simple trend line between 2018 highs and April highs. The results are obvious. But that’s not the point because in the last two months for example, Ethereum buyers have been trying to make a comeback.</p>\n<p>In this chart for example we note that while May was bearish, it didn’t manage to fully reverse April gains. As such, we have a higher high if we connect April and May lows but what’s different is that May’s weekly candlesticks were low in volumes and pales in comparison with April market participation levels. Because of these interesting developments chances are we might see buyers building up from last week’s bullish candlestick and break above $650.</p>\n<h4>Daily Chart</h4>\n<div id="attachment_334692" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-334692" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/04173237/Ethereum-Daily-Chart-for-June-5.png" alt="Ethereum (ETH) Price Technical Analysis" width="1280" height="1024" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><strong><em>Ethereum Daily Chart by Trading View</em></strong></a></p></div>\n<p>Here we have nice series of higher highs and as expected, the correction we saw yesterday is but normal. In case you want to pick out perfect bull entries then zoom in to the 4HR chart. From there you can wait for reversals at around $550 minor support line. In the meantime though, traders can stay on the side lines. I only recommend entries when we see up-thrusts above $650. Coincidentally, this level happens to be above May 23 highs. Then again, note that May 23 was the beginning of a climactic sells. Fortunately for hodlers, bears slowed down on May 28 and from there prices begun bottoming out.</p>\n</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/05/ethereum-eth-price-technical-analysis-june-5-2018/" data-wpel-link="internal">Vitalik&#8217;s Sharding and Plasma is Justin Sun&#8217;s 10,000 TPS Checkmate: Ethereum (ETH) Price Technical Analysis (June 5, 2018)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com" data-wpel-link="internal">NewsBTC</a>.</p>',

Why? Well, solid data reveals that 10 addresses holds up-to 50 percent of EOS coin supply. That’s 500 Million EOS coins under 10 addresses of which Block One is one of the biggest hodlers. It’s ridiculous because aside from raising $4 billion from their one year long crowd funding, they hold an additional 100 million EOS coins.</p>\n<p>This gifts them an extra $1.5 billion if we make deductions from spot USD rates. In the top 10 list, the least address has 20.39 million EOS coins and the rest which many believe to be exchanges controls upwards of 150 million EOS coins. That’s not all. When it comes to “decentralization”, the top 1000 addresses control 86 percent of the total supply meaning when it comes to voting and governance, your vote won’t be influential as you have been made to think.</p>\n<p>When it comes to price action, we shall <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/04/tron-iota-eos-stellar-litecoin-price-technical-analysis-june-4-2018/" data-wpel-link="internal">retain our bullish projection</a> but in this case of long covering, bears might continue pushing EOS prices lower. In this regard, June 2 bullish candlestick would act as a minor resistance and support in the days to come. After all, volumes are low and pales in comparison to June 2 price action.

Our analysis will anchor on June 3 candlestick which had high volumes but price oscillations were within a tight range. This “subtle” rejection of higher highs came to pass with yesterday’s candlestick. Because of this technical development, potential support lies between $110 and $115. That range would be an ideal zones buyers in the 4HR chart. If not and this applies to conservatives, Litecoin buyers must have to wait for close above $130 as we have been insisting in previous trade plans.</p>\n<h2>Stellar Lumens (XLM) Price Technical Analysis</h2>\n<div id="attachment_334700" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-334700" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/04174229/Stellar-Lumens-Daily-Chart-for-June-5.png" alt="Stellar Lumens (XLM) Price Technical Analysis" width="1280" height="1024" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XLMUSD/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><strong><em>Stellar Lumens Daily Chart by Trading View</em></strong></a></p></div>\n<p>Week over week, <a href="https://coinlib.io/coin/XLM/Stellar" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Stellar prices are up 10 percent</a> but in the last 24 hours, they are down five percent.

This cutting-edge technology that we mostly know as the host behind cryptocurrencies has an immense broadness of possibilities that most people are just barely starting to understand at the moment.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the measure that we get to use more the blockchain, the more we will know all of the capabilities behind it, and that&rsquo;s for sure something that companies like <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/own-ripple-xrp-hodl-it-bank-of-america-to-adopt-soon/">Ripple (XRP)</a> have more than clear.</p>\n<p>In this sense, it was known this Monday that Ripple, still a start-up but highly regarded crypto in the industry, just decided to make a courageous bet on the blockchain adoption. Like this, the company resolved to invest the remarkable amount of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/crypto-start-up-ripple-donates-50m-to-top-schools-to-boost-blockchain.html">50 million dollars</a> in several renowned universities (17 total) among we can find the University of North Carolina, the University of Pennsylvania, and a research institute at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the investment will have an objective to promote and boost the adoption of the blockchain technologies. Of course, as a cryptocurrency user, this is a fact that cannot be ignored, and I can say I&rsquo;m more than thrilled to get to know about it. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes!</p>\n<h3>University Blockchain Research Initiative</h3>\n<p>Under the name of &ldquo;<em>University Blockchain Research Initiative,</em>&rdquo; <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ripple-xrp-expect-the-bull-to-visit-shortly/">Ripple</a> has created a program that seeks to boost the adoption of the blockchain technologies. At least $50 million will be donated to the program, and the company has already clarified that the donation will be in actual dollars and not crypto.</p>\n<p>According to declarations made by the Senior Vice President of the company,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanmiltenburg">Eric van Miltenburg</a>, the initiative surged from an astonishing increase in the demand of jobs related to the blockchain. Miltenburg stated that this year alone at least 4,500 jobs were published with the words &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; or &ldquo;cryptocurrencies&rdquo; on the social network LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Besides noting this represents an increase of <em>150 percent</em> compared to the offers in the site that involved such terms last year, he continued and said that this is a natural thing to happen as every time we live in a more globalized environment where the demand of technological solutions every day increases, a fact of which the blockchain would not be the exception.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s recall that the blockchain is the technology that serves as the conductor for what we know as virtual coins or cryptocurrencies. In fact, <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ripple-ceo-bitcoin-dominance-about-to-end/">Ripple</a> is a company related to the sector specifically through products that seek to improve real-time operations for financial entities.</p>\n<p>The company possesses its very own cryptocurrency dubbed <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/why-ripple-xrp-is-good-investment-under-zero-point-75-usd/">XRP</a>, a coin that currently is ranked as the number 3 of the market by the market capitalization tracker site Coinmarketcap. Although the primary purpose of the program is not to enhance the usage or performance of the digital coin of <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/4-strategic-alliances-can-shoot-ripple-xrp-moon/">Ripple</a>, the company specified that some universities involved in the study would use the products of Ripple and most likely the XRP token.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This initiative represents without a doubt a very positive thing for the cryptocurrency industry. Even when the purpose is not to promote the usage of cryptocurrencies, it still is an excellent approach as it will give the opportunity to interact with the technology behind such financial forms.</p>\n<p>This can definitely be the start of a very good time for <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ripple-xrp-3-mark-2018/">Ripple (XRP)</a>, which despite being the number 3 of the market as of the moment has had one of the worst performances of the sector <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ripple-q1-report-2018-how-well-the-xrp-performed/">on 2018</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

However, when it comes to the space of smart contracts, utilization, dApps, tokens &#8211; Ethereum can not be forgotten. <a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-eth-price-clears-the-600-00-as-the-market-is-reversing-speedy/">Ethereum</a> has become a sensation in the cryptocurrency space by opening up the blockchain for anyone across the world to develop and run various codes.</p>\n<h3>Ethereum Blockchain</h3>\n<p>According to a just made research on the <a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/?s=ethereum">Ethereum blockchain</a>, the network is supporting over 1k applications. Various tokens and coins following up on the list by market capitalization are created on Ethereum&#8217;s network. Many other blockchains that support smart contracts have been coming up but Ethereum still is the go-to platform for tokens and decentralized applications.</p>\n<p>Ethereum (ETH), the second-ranked cryptocurrency has now overtaken Bitcoin (BTC) based on the number of unique addresses. While this stat does not in itself tell the full story, another surprising statistic has emerged. Ethereum has for the first time surpassed Bitcoin in the number of active addresses.</p>\n<p>The 35 million unique ETH addresses are representing 100% increase since end of 2017. The second-ranked crypto based on market cap is reportedly adding an average of 100,000 addresses per day.</p>\n<p>Keeping in mind that ETH wallets re-use addresses while BTC wallets do not, we can conclude that there is more cryptocurrency activity around Ethereum than Bitcoin.</p>\n<h3>ETH/USD</h3>\n<p>Ethereum (ETH) price was affected by the volatility in the market during the Q1 of 2018. ETH/USD plummeted to trade below $360 on April 1. The cryptocurrency, however, battled shaking off the bear pressure through the month of April. Ethereum price traded highs of $829 in the first week of May before the current bear trend took over.</p>\n<p>A week ago, the pair ETH/USD deep-dived below the $560.00 to test the $500.00. Despite that after making it above the $600.00, the token price dropped to $593.00 per time of writing &#8211; Ethereum still has strong potential to go beyond $1,000.00 this year.</p>\n<p>There have been bullish predictions from experts, besides it has shown that it has the ability to recover after severe downside movements in the market.</p>\n<p><a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Untitled.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12306" src="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Untitled.jpg" alt="Ethereum" width="814" height="590" srcset="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Untitled.jpg 814w, https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Untitled-300x217.jpg 300w, https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Untitled-768x557.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /></a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/cryptocurrency-recommendation-ethereum-eth-choices/">Cryptocurrency Recommendation: Ethereum (ETH) under Best Choices</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ethereumworldnews.com">Ethereum World News</a>.</p>',

Coffey claims that he lost $551.89 trading Ripple&rsquo;s XRP tokens, alleging that the digital currency should have been registered as a security with the SEC. He alleges that Ripple profited from increases in the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency&rsquo;s</a> price at the expense of investors as Ripple maintains a &ldquo;centralized XRP&rdquo; ledger.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The plaintiff is looking to rescind over $300 mln in XRP purchases and set up a trust over the proceeds of Ripple&rsquo;s alleged sales of digital currency.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The filings also state that the case has been moved from California state court to a federal court in the Northern District of California. Ripple&rsquo;s lawyers say that the suit should be handled in federal court rather than in the San Francisco Superior Court, where the complaint was initially filed.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Ripple&rsquo;s spokeswoman said that at the moment the lawsuit was filed, the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/sec">SEC</a> had not yet decided whether XRP is a security. &ldquo;We continue to believe XRP should not be classified as a security,&rdquo; she claimed in response to the complaint, adding:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;We feel confident that the claims regarding XRP are completely unfounded both in law and fact.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Taylor-Copeland, the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyer said that moving the case to federal court was &ldquo;entirely improper&rdquo; and that he intends to return it to the state judiciary system. He commented on the case:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Whether or not their XRP token is a security is an existential threat to their entire business model.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In April, former Goldman Sachs partner and government regulator Gary Gensler <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-us-govt-regulator-considers-eth-xrp-likely-noncompliant-securities">said</a> that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum</a> (ETH) and Ripple should likely be considered unregistered securities. Gensler noted that he does not classify <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> as a security because it was not issued through an Initial Coin Offering and has a decentralized network of developers. In regards to ETH and XRP, he said that &ldquo;there is a strong case for both of them &mdash; but particularly Ripple &mdash; that they are noncompliant securities.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>',

The cryptocurrency faced its &ldquo;most recent death&rdquo; in the latest &ldquo;obituary&rdquo; provided by <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/forbes">Forbes</a>.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin celebrates its 300th death anniversary following <a  href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2018/05/30/bitcoins-need-for-electricity-is-its-achilles-heel/3/#10a39357b87a" rel="nofollow,noopener"  target="_blank">an article</a> from Forbes published May 30. The article claims that Bitcoin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Achilles Heel&rdquo; is the huge amount of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/electricity">electricity</a> required by crypto <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/mining">mining</a> operations.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">According to Forbes, Bitcoin miners underestimate the risks associated with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/energy">energy</a> consumption on the global scale. The report also stresses such issues as power theft and the cost of mining equipment that is becoming more and more expensive:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Predictably, Bitcoin miners downplay both their energy usage and the threat it poses to ordinary people, ordinary businesses and the planet that they occupy.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p dir="ltr">At the time of the latest &ldquo;death&rdquo; recorded by 99Bitcoins, BTC was trading at $7,312. In December, when Bitcoin died it&rsquo;s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rip-cryptocurrency-dies-200th-time-just-as-price-hits-11k">200th</a> death, the BTC price hit the $11,000 mark. According to 99Bitcoins stats, the major cryptocurrency &ldquo;died&rdquo; 62 times this year.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">This year, various pundits and public figures proffered their own suggestions as to why Bitcoin is doomed to fail, including the notorious <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/warren-buffett">Warren Buffet</a> statement that Bitcoin is <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/warren-buffett-charlie-munger-slam-bitcoin-again-resort-to-elementary-school-insults">&quot;probably rat poison squared,&quot;</a> &nbsp;and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bank-of-england">Bank of England</a> Governor Mark Carney&rsquo;s claim &nbsp;that BTC has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/boe-governor-mark-carney-crypto-ecosystem-should-be-held-to-same-standards">&ldquo;failed&rdquo; as a currency</a>.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">While Bitcoin has recently faced its 300th death and dropped in value by around <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">20 percent</a> last month, several prominent figures in the tech and business worlds have made bullish statements on its future. Recently, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-the-only-digital-gold?utm_source=Telegram&amp;utm_medium=Social">said</a> that &ldquo;only Bitcoin is pure digital gold,&rdquo; reiterating the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-ceo-says-bitcoin-will-become-worlds-single-currency-within-a-decad">statement</a> of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/twitter">Twitter</a> CEO Jack Dorsey that in a decade BTC will be the &ldquo;single currency&rdquo; of the world and the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/internet">Internet</a>.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">Cointelegraph&rsquo;s price index</a>, BTC is trading at $7,407 at press time, having gained around 4 percent over the past week.</p>\n</p>',

In an interview with CNBC at the Money20/20 conference in Amsterdam, Wozniak said he agrees with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey about Bitcoin emerging from the plethora of 1,000+ cryptocurrencies to become the dominant single currency.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it&#8217;s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The world ultimately will have a single currency, the internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be Bitcoin,&#8221; Dorsey told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bitcoin-will-become-the-worlds-single-currency-tech-chief-says-66slm0p6b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Times</a>. He indicated a probable timeframe of &#8220;over 10 years, but it could go faster.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea of a single world currency isn&#8217;t new. A <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2009/09/24/reserve-currencies-in-the-post-crisis-international-monetary-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog posted by the International Monetary Fund</a> on September 24, 2009 by Reza Moghadam details how a global world currency could function.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“An even more ambitious solution would be to move to a truly global currency, along the lines of Keynes’s &#8216;bancor&#8217;, that would circulate alongside countries’ own currencies and would offer a store of value truly disconnected from economic conditions and policies in any country. To achieve this, one would need to set up a global monetary institution that would issue the global currency depending on global economic conditions, and that could act as a global lender of last resort. It would need to have an impeccable (&#8216;AAAA”) balance sheet, and governance arrangements that engender widespread credibility and acceptability.” </em></p>\n<p>Economist Kenneth Rogoff wrote about a global currency in May 2001 in a paper entitled, &#8220;<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rogoff/files/why_not_a_global_currency.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Not a Global Currency?</a>&#8221; and economist Richard N. Cooper wrote a <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1984-09-01/monetary-system-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seminal paper</a> on the topic, &#8220;A Monetary System for the Future&#8221; in 1984.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin and several leading cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash differ significantly from earlier predictions about a global currency. Cryptocurrencies are based on mathematical proofs using blockchain technology in decentralized networks, as opposed to government-backed fiat currencies that are controlled by central banks.</p>\n<p>Wozniak, who once owned seven Bitcoin but had them all <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/steve-wozniak-had-his-bitcoins-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stolen</a> during a fraudulent transaction where someone purchased the tech guru&#8217;s Bitcoin through a credit card transaction that was canceled, is still very optimistic about the technology because it cannot be manipulated by governments. &#8220;It is mathematical. It is pure. It can&#8217;t be altered.&#8221;</p>\n<center><script async src="https://serve.czilladx.com/serve/jslib/fb.js"></script>\n<!-- Coinzilla Banner 300x250 -->\n<div class="coinzilla" data-zone="436775a91f3b146169" data-w="300" data-h="250"  style="max-width: 300px; width:100%; display: inline-block;"></div></center>\n<h6>Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The wedge spans $7,000 to $7,800 so the resulting drop could be of the same height.</p>\n<p>However, price is also finding support around the Fib levels marked on the breakout move. Recall that bitcoin also surged past a longer-term descending trend line that&#8217;s been holding for the entire month of May. This signals that bulls could be charging but that a pullback is necessary to draw more buying pressure.</p>\n<p>The 61.8% Fib retracement level is closest to the broken trend line around $7,300 and could be enough to keep losses at bay. A bounce off any of these levels could take price back up to the swing high at $7,800 and higher.</p>\n<p>The 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA, though, so the path of least resistance is to the downside. The gap between the moving averages is also widening to reflect stronger selling pressure and the 100 SMA has recently held as dynamic resistance.</p>\n<p>RSI is on the move down, also confirming that sellers have the upper hand. Similarly, stochastic is heading lower so bitcoin could follow suit. Both oscillators are approaching oversold levels to reflect exhaustion among bears, and turning higher could bring buyers back in.</p>\n<p><a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12311" src="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc-1024x619.png" alt="" width="1024" height="619" srcset="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc-1024x619.png 1024w, https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc-300x181.png 300w, https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc-768x464.png 768w, https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc.png 1172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>\n<p>The US dollar regained ground against its peers in the US session even though there were no major catalysts.

For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That&#8217;s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some blame technical factors for the drop and are looking at make-or-break scenarios around other moving averages.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-btc-price-analysis-downside-wedge-break-but-support-near/">Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: Downside Wedge Break But Support Near</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ethereumworldnews.com">Ethereum World News</a>.</p>',

This was made possible through the efforts of FinTech startup Eligma.</p>\n<p>Eligma has created a point of sale system known as Elipay. The system will be used across the shopping complex, which is coincidentally named BTC City as the company who owned it was named BTC Company.</p>\n<p>Miro Cerar, the prime minister of Slovenia, recently visited the complex and was bought a &lsquo;crypto coffee&rsquo; by his State Secretary, Tadej Slapnick. The coffee was bought using the Elipay service.

        content: '<p>Ripple&rsquo;s David Schwartz recently released a blog post on Ripple&rsquo;s &#8216;Insight&#8217; page on why open payment protocols will be the first step in changing payment and settlement systems across the world.</p>\n<p>He started by talking about the genesis of the Internet, and how various standardized protocols made it into what we know today. Standards such as the Internet Protocol, HTTP, and SMTP allowed for the interoperability and connection we see today. These open protocols were then developed upon to allow newer advancements such as streaming and the Internet of Things.</p>\n<p>As Ripple pushes its vision for the Internet of Value, it is apparent that they intend to establish it in the same way the Internet grew. InterLedger Protocol [ILP] is a universal format protocol just like IP, except it takes the form of an open protocol suite for payments across different ledger systems.</p>\n<p>David Schwartz developed the protocol along with Stefan Tomas, who left Ripple to start a company known as <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/cto-ripple-steps-down-announces-new-company-coil/">Coil</a>. Coil demonstrates the use of the ILP to change the way content is monetized on the Internet.</p>\n<p>The ILP has also been integrated into Ripple&rsquo;s product for cross-border payments, xCurrent. This is keeping in view with the privacy, speed, and flexibility needs expressed by Ripple&rsquo;s partners. ILP satisfies these needs by allowing for instant and certain transactions to be processed across an infinite number of ledgers.</p>\n<p>Schwartz said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By connecting bank ledgers and existing infrastructure investments via ILP, banks are taking the first steps in improving global payments today &mdash; and in enabling a true Internet of Value.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ripple also aims to scale global payments as a part of their vision. Banks are under pressure from a small group of correspondent bankers charging high fees, and from non-bank payment companies that capitalize on these opportunities.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Schwartz states that the next step after connecting these ledgers is to allow for settlement using a digital asset for on-demand liquidity. This takes the form of Ripple&rsquo;s xRapid solution. The solution will allow aforementioned banks to save time and money on cross-border payments, as seen by the results of recent xRapid pilots.</p>\n<p>Schwartz also believes that Ripple&rsquo;s products will lay the foundation for the next 50 years. In accordance with this, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This starts with providing technology that the current financial structure is comfortable with: xCurrent, blockchain technology that provides cryptographically secure transactions across a dispersed network of ledgers and integrates easily with existing systems&#8230;In the same way that IP dug new plumbing for the Internet, revamping global payments must start at the bottom infrastructure layer and move up from here.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com/ripples-schwartz-interledger-protocol-become-universal-payments-format/">Ripple&#8217;s Schwartz says InterLedger Protocol will become a &#8216;universal payments format&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com">AMBCrypto</a>.</p>',

The selloff started yesterday during the US session and has continued into today as all gains since Friday have been wiped out. Bitcoin has led the decline by falling 3.5% on the day to $7,430 and Ethereum has taken a bigger hit dropping 5.5% to $585. No news has initiated the fall; it has just become an expected symptom of a sideways market. Altcoins are predictably in the red this morning in Asia, and just as predictably the only one that performs well during a selloff is DigixDAO.</p>\n<p>Everything in the top 25 has plummeted according to Coinmarketcap. To find an altcoin in the green we have to go way down the list to spot 50 where DGD is trading 17% higher. Gold based DigixDAO is currently trading at $165, up from $142 this time yesterday. Over the week it is up 36% from $123 this time last Tuesday.  The past month has not been good for DGD however as it has lost 35% from $260 this time last month. Against Bitcoin it is up 23% on the day to 2267700 satoshis from 1845000 sats this time yesterday. Weekly gains on BTC have been 31% from 1726000 satoshis this time last week.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-334760" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/05040816/dgdchart6.jpg" alt="" width="1130" height="496" /></p>\n<p>Gold backed Ethereum token DigixDAO always seems to defy the selloff and perform well when all other cryptos are plummeting. In a similar pattern to gold versus fiat it has become somewhat predictable and traders are loading up.  The Digix Gold Token DGX was listed on Airswap a few days ago but this current pump is likely to have been caused by inverse action on other altcoins.</p>\n<p>Binance currently takes the lion’s share of DGD trade with around 86% of the total volume, most of that in BTC. That volume has rocketed up from $1.6 million to $33 million over the past 24 hours as investors dump Bitcoin and alts and get into what they perceive to be a more stable digital asset. Currently just outside the top 50, DigixDAO has a market cap of $330 million.</p>\n<p>Total market capitalization for all cryptos has fallen for the first time in almost a week. The upward momentum could not be maintained and the bears have beaten the bulls in this instance. $20 billion has left the market in the past 24 hours and things have fallen by 5.7% to $332 billion. As we have seen many times before 3-4 day’s gains are obliterated in just one. All other altcoins are dropping during Asian trade this morning, those taking the biggest beating are Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Icon and Lisk.</p>\n<p>More on Digix can be found here: <a href="https://digix.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">https://digix.global/</a></p>\n<p><em>FOMO Moments is a section that takes a daily look at the top 25 altcoins during the Asian trading session and analyses the best performing one, looking for trends and possible fundamentals.</em></p>\n</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/05/asian-cryptocurrency-trading-update-gold-backed-digixdao-defies-selloff/" data-wpel-link="internal">Asian Cryptocurrency Trading Update: Gold Backed DigixDAO Defies Selloff</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com" data-wpel-link="internal">NewsBTC</a>.</p>',

        content: '<p>Ripple&rsquo;s David Schwartz recently released a blog post on Ripple&rsquo;s &#8216;Insight&#8217; page on why open payment protocols will be the first step in changing payment and settlement systems across the world.</p>\n<p>He started by talking about the genesis of the Internet, and how various standardized protocols made it into what we know today. Standards such as the Internet Protocol, HTTP, and SMTP allowed for the interoperability and connection we see today. These open protocols were then developed upon to allow newer advancements such as streaming and the Internet of Things.</p>\n<p>As Ripple pushes its vision for the Internet of Value, it is apparent that they intend to establish it in the same way the Internet grew. InterLedger Protocol [ILP] is a universal format protocol just like IP, except it takes the form of an open protocol suite for payments across different ledger systems.</p>\n<p>David Schwartz developed the protocol along with Stefan Tomas, who left Ripple to start a company known as <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/cto-ripple-steps-down-announces-new-company-coil/">Coil</a>. Coil demonstrates the use of the ILP to change the way content is monetized on the Internet.</p>\n<p>The ILP has also been integrated into Ripple&rsquo;s product for cross-border payments, xCurrent. This is keeping in view with the privacy, speed, and flexibility needs expressed by Ripple&rsquo;s partners. ILP satisfies these needs by allowing for instant and certain transactions to be processed across an infinite number of ledgers.</p>\n<p>Schwartz said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By connecting bank ledgers and existing infrastructure investments via ILP, banks are taking the first steps in improving global payments today &mdash; and in enabling a true Internet of Value.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ripple also aims to scale global payments as a part of their vision. Banks are under pressure from a small group of correspondent bankers charging high fees, and from non-bank payment companies that capitalize on these opportunities.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Schwartz states that the next step after connecting these ledgers is to allow for settlement using a digital asset for on-demand liquidity. This takes the form of Ripple&rsquo;s xRapid solution. The solution will allow aforementioned banks to save time and money on cross-border payments, as seen by the results of recent xRapid pilots.</p>\n<p>Schwartz also believes that Ripple&rsquo;s products will lay the foundation for the next 50 years. In accordance with this, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This starts with providing technology that the current financial structure is comfortable with: xCurrent, blockchain technology that provides cryptographically secure transactions across a dispersed network of ledgers and integrates easily with existing systems&#8230;In the same way that IP dug new plumbing for the Internet, revamping global payments must start at the bottom infrastructure layer and move up from here.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com/ripples-schwartz-interledger-protocol-become-universal-payments-format/">Ripple&#8217;s Schwartz says InterLedger Protocol will become a &#8216;universal payments format&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com">AMBCrypto</a>.</p>',

Smart contracts must be formally verified, so they run exactly as specified and are free from bugs or flaws. Only then can they be widely adopted as financial infrastructure that can be relied upon by billions of people.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cardano is a smart contract platform that functions mostly like Ethereum, but it was designed by the IOHK team in such a way that it accommodates numerous upgrades and updates without destabilizing the network with hard forks. As such it, offers the capacity for its blockchain protocol to scale to levels that other altcoins can&#8217;t reach. It is already being looked into by governments in developing nations.</p>\n</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/05/cardano-ada-price-watch-watch-reversal-breakout-correction/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cardano (ADA) Price Watch: Watch Out for this Reversal Breakout Correction</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com" data-wpel-link="internal">NewsBTC</a>.</p>',

The selloff started yesterday during the US session and has continued into today as all gains since Friday have been wiped out. Bitcoin has led the decline by falling 3.5% on the day to $7,430 and Ethereum has taken a bigger hit dropping 5.5% to $585. No news has initiated the fall; it has just become an expected symptom of a sideways market. Altcoins are predictably in the red this morning in Asia, and just as predictably the only one that performs well during a selloff is DigixDAO.</p>\n<p>Everything in the top 25 has plummeted according to Coinmarketcap. To find an altcoin in the green we have to go way down the list to spot 50 where DGD is trading 17% higher. Gold based DigixDAO is currently trading at $165, up from $142 this time yesterday. Over the week it is up 36% from $123 this time last Tuesday.  The past month has not been good for DGD however as it has lost 35% from $260 this time last month. Against Bitcoin it is up 23% on the day to 2267700 satoshis from 1845000 sats this time yesterday. Weekly gains on BTC have been 31% from 1726000 satoshis this time last week.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-334760" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/05040816/dgdchart6.jpg" alt="" width="1130" height="496" /></p>\n<p>Gold backed Ethereum token DigixDAO always seems to defy the selloff and perform well when all other cryptos are plummeting. In a similar pattern to gold versus fiat it has become somewhat predictable and traders are loading up.  The Digix Gold Token DGX was listed on Airswap a few days ago but this current pump is likely to have been caused by inverse action on other altcoins.</p>\n<p>Binance currently takes the lion’s share of DGD trade with around 86% of the total volume, most of that in BTC. That volume has rocketed up from $1.6 million to $33 million over the past 24 hours as investors dump Bitcoin and alts and get into what they perceive to be a more stable digital asset. Currently just outside the top 50, DigixDAO has a market cap of $330 million.</p>\n<p>Total market capitalization for all cryptos has fallen for the first time in almost a week. The upward momentum could not be maintained and the bears have beaten the bulls in this instance. $20 billion has left the market in the past 24 hours and things have fallen by 5.7% to $332 billion. As we have seen many times before 3-4 day’s gains are obliterated in just one. All other altcoins are dropping during Asian trade this morning, those taking the biggest beating are Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Icon and Lisk.</p>\n<p>More on Digix can be found here: <a href="https://digix.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">https://digix.global/</a></p>\n<p><em>FOMO Moments is a section that takes a daily look at the top 25 altcoins during the Asian trading session and analyses the best performing one, looking for trends and possible fundamentals.</em></p>\n</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/05/asian-cryptocurrency-trading-update-gold-backed-digixdao-defies-selloff/" data-wpel-link="internal">Asian Cryptocurrency Trading Update: Gold Backed DigixDAO Defies Selloff</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com" data-wpel-link="internal">NewsBTC</a>.</p>',

A larger pullback to the broken trend line closer to the 61.8% Fib may be the last line of defense for bulls, and a break below this could lead to a drop to the swing low.</p>\n<div id="attachment_334755" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-334755 size-large" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/05033713/180605_bitcoin-1100x683.png" alt="" width="1100" height="683" /><p class="wp-caption-text">BTCUSD Chart from TradingView</p></div>\n<p><strong>Market Factors</strong></p>\n<p>Bitcoin was off to a promising start for the week but it looks like bulls were unable to sustain the momentum as investor worries lingered.

To achieve this, one would need to set up a global monetary institution that would issue the global currency depending on global economic conditions, and that could act as a global lender of last resort. It would need to have an impeccable (&#8216;AAAA”) balance sheet, and governance arrangements that engender widespread credibility and acceptability.” </em></p>\n<p>Economist Kenneth Rogoff wrote about a global currency in May 2001 in a paper entitled, &#8220;<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rogoff/files/why_not_a_global_currency.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Not a Global Currency?</a>&#8221; and economist Richard N.

Cryptocurrencies are based on mathematical proofs using blockchain technology in decentralized networks, as opposed to government-backed fiat currencies that are controlled by central banks.</p>\n<p>Wozniak, who once owned seven Bitcoin but had them all <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/steve-wozniak-had-his-bitcoins-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stolen</a> during a fraudulent transaction where someone purchased the tech guru&#8217;s Bitcoin through a credit card transaction that was canceled, is still very optimistic about the technology because it cannot be manipulated by governments. &#8220;It is mathematical.

The wedge spans $7,000 to $7,800 so the resulting drop could be of the same height.</p>\n<p>However, price is also finding support around the Fib levels marked on the breakout move. Recall that bitcoin also surged past a longer-term descending trend line that&#8217;s been holding for the entire month of May. This signals that bulls could be charging but that a pullback is necessary to draw more buying pressure.</p>\n<p>The 61.8% Fib retracement level is closest to the broken trend line around $7,300 and could be enough to keep losses at bay. A bounce off any of these levels could take price back up to the swing high at $7,800 and higher.</p>\n<p>The 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA, though, so the path of least resistance is to the downside. The gap between the moving averages is also widening to reflect stronger selling pressure and the 100 SMA has recently held as dynamic resistance.</p>\n<p>RSI is on the move down, also confirming that sellers have the upper hand. Similarly, stochastic is heading lower so bitcoin could follow suit. Both oscillators are approaching oversold levels to reflect exhaustion among bears, and turning higher could bring buyers back in.</p>\n<p><a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12311" src="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc-1024x619.png" alt="" width="1024" height="619" srcset="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc-1024x619.png 1024w, https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc-300x181.png 300w, https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc-768x464.png 768w, https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_btc.png 1172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>\n<p>The US dollar regained ground against its peers in the US session even though there were no major catalysts.

This was made possible through the efforts of FinTech startup Eligma.</p>\n<p>Eligma has created a point of sale system known as Elipay. The system will be used across the shopping complex, which is coincidentally named BTC City as the company who owned it was named BTC Company.</p>\n<p>Miro Cerar, the prime minister of Slovenia, recently visited the complex and was bought a &lsquo;crypto coffee&rsquo; by his State Secretary, Tadej Slapnick. The coffee was bought using the Elipay service. On the project, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;[It is] a business and shopping ecosystem based on the latest technological solutions including blockchain, AI, and cryptocurrencies.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The city was founded in 1954 as a warehouse and logistics enterprise, and as more buildings were added by BTC Company, it was repurposed in 1990.</p>\n<p>The repurpose resulted in its conversion to a shopping complex, which then grew to include Slovenia&rsquo;s tallest building, a casino, a sports complex, a multiplex, and a hotel. It has over 500 buildings and describes itself as the most popular &ldquo;European business, shopping and recreational/leisure and culture centre&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The Elipay system is installed in the water park and stores such as Al Capone, Babadu, Big Bang, istyle, Martino, and Sneakers. The complex also boasts of Slovenia&rsquo;s &ldquo;biggest mining rig&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Eligma said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The purpose of his visit was to open the Beyond 4.0 international conference, dedicated to digital society and blockchain, as well as to get acquainted with BTC City&rsquo;s strategy to become Bitcoin City.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Reddit user btcinvesteringalex said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How did I not read about this by now. Great to hear!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>User homopit:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;the app would also be able to use bitcoin cash&#8230; &#8230;in the near future.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-btc-slovenias-biggest-shopping-complex/">Bitcoin [BTC] to be accepted at Slovenia&#8217;s biggest shopping complex</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com">AMBCrypto</a>.</p>',

Mary Jo White previously held the position of chair at the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa">US</a> <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/sec">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC).</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The <a  href="https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/403/16324/RippleRemoval.pdf" rel="nofollow,noopener"  target="_blank">court paper</a> for <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ripple">Ripple</a> (XRP) reveals that the attorneys will represent the company in a lawsuit <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/class-action-lawsuit-against-ripple-alleges-sale-of-unregistered-securities">filed by investor Ryan Coffey last month</a>. Coffey claims that he lost $551.89 trading Ripple&rsquo;s XRP tokens, alleging that the digital currency should have been registered as a security with the SEC. He alleges that Ripple profited from increases in the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency&rsquo;s</a> price at the expense of investors as Ripple maintains a &ldquo;centralized XRP&rdquo; ledger.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The plaintiff is looking to rescind over $300 mln in XRP purchases and set up a trust over the proceeds of Ripple&rsquo;s alleged sales of digital currency.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The filings also state that the case has been moved from California state court to a federal court in the Northern District of California. Ripple&rsquo;s lawyers say that the suit should be handled in federal court rather than in the San Francisco Superior Court, where the complaint was initially filed.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Ripple&rsquo;s spokeswoman said that at the moment the lawsuit was filed, the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/sec">SEC</a> had not yet decided whether XRP is a security. &ldquo;We continue to believe XRP should not be classified as a security,&rdquo; she claimed in response to the complaint, adding:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;We feel confident that the claims regarding XRP are completely unfounded both in law and fact.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Taylor-Copeland, the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyer said that moving the case to federal court was &ldquo;entirely improper&rdquo; and that he intends to return it to the state judiciary system. He commented on the case:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Whether or not their XRP token is a security is an existential threat to their entire business model.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In April, former Goldman Sachs partner and government regulator Gary Gensler <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-us-govt-regulator-considers-eth-xrp-likely-noncompliant-securities">said</a> that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum</a> (ETH) and Ripple should likely be considered unregistered securities. Gensler noted that he does not classify <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> as a security because it was not issued through an Initial Coin Offering and has a decentralized network of developers. In regards to ETH and XRP, he said that &ldquo;there is a strong case for both of them &mdash; but particularly Ripple &mdash; that they are noncompliant securities.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>',

The cryptocurrency faced its &ldquo;most recent death&rdquo; in the latest &ldquo;obituary&rdquo; provided by <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/forbes">Forbes</a>.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin celebrates its 300th death anniversary following <a  href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2018/05/30/bitcoins-need-for-electricity-is-its-achilles-heel/3/#10a39357b87a" rel="nofollow,noopener"  target="_blank">an article</a> from Forbes published May 30. The article claims that Bitcoin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Achilles Heel&rdquo; is the huge amount of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/electricity">electricity</a> required by crypto <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/mining">mining</a> operations.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">According to Forbes, Bitcoin miners underestimate the risks associated with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/energy">energy</a> consumption on the global scale. The report also stresses such issues as power theft and the cost of mining equipment that is becoming more and more expensive:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Predictably, Bitcoin miners downplay both their energy usage and the threat it poses to ordinary people, ordinary businesses and the planet that they occupy.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p dir="ltr">At the time of the latest &ldquo;death&rdquo; recorded by 99Bitcoins, BTC was trading at $7,312. In December, when Bitcoin died it&rsquo;s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rip-cryptocurrency-dies-200th-time-just-as-price-hits-11k">200th</a> death, the BTC price hit the $11,000 mark. According to 99Bitcoins stats, the major cryptocurrency &ldquo;died&rdquo; 62 times this year.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">This year, various pundits and public figures proffered their own suggestions as to why Bitcoin is doomed to fail, including the notorious <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/warren-buffett">Warren Buffet</a> statement that Bitcoin is <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/warren-buffett-charlie-munger-slam-bitcoin-again-resort-to-elementary-school-insults">&quot;probably rat poison squared,&quot;</a> &nbsp;and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bank-of-england">Bank of England</a> Governor Mark Carney&rsquo;s claim &nbsp;that BTC has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/boe-governor-mark-carney-crypto-ecosystem-should-be-held-to-same-standards">&ldquo;failed&rdquo; as a currency</a>.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">While Bitcoin has recently faced its 300th death and dropped in value by around <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">20 percent</a> last month, several prominent figures in the tech and business worlds have made bullish statements on its future. Recently, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-the-only-digital-gold?utm_source=Telegram&amp;utm_medium=Social">said</a> that &ldquo;only Bitcoin is pure digital gold,&rdquo; reiterating the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-ceo-says-bitcoin-will-become-worlds-single-currency-within-a-decad">statement</a> of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/twitter">Twitter</a> CEO Jack Dorsey that in a decade BTC will be the &ldquo;single currency&rdquo; of the world and the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/internet">Internet</a>.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">Cointelegraph&rsquo;s price index</a>, BTC is trading at $7,407 at press time, having gained around 4 percent over the past week.</p>\n</p>',

Zhang did not predict when such a bubble burst may occur. She said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bubble">bubble</a> to break. We still see a lot of hype in the market, valuations are high and unreasonable. We really think if the bubble bursts, it&rsquo;s a good thing for the industry.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Additionally, Zhang said that she is helping Binance to deal with the scams that have emerged as a result of the hype, with so-called Cryptocurrency Governance Initiatives, or CGI. The purpose of the initiative is to &ldquo;fight scams and sh*t coins, and to boost crypto and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain technology</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Within the initiative, Binance will reportedly support funds and token teams it&rsquo;s working with, but &nbsp;they must promise that &quot;they won&rsquo;t participate in pump and dump&quot; schemes, and that they will build products according to their white papers. Binance will stop investing in funds and delist tokens from teams that do not honor their commitments.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Over the next three to five years, Binance Labs <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-crypto-exchange-binance-seeks-20-major-partners-for-giant-1-bln-fund">plans to invest</a> $1 bln of Binance profits in various projects, with an average investment per project between $1 mln and $10 mln. There are 20 different cryptocurrency funds with whom Binance plans to collaborate as part of the new venture capital fund. All the projects involved will be obligated to join CGI. The fund has reportedly made four investments in both companies&rsquo; tokens and equity so far.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Zhang, who was previously an investment director at venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, believes there can be a conflict between investing in tokens and equity, as they are valued differently. She said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;If we see founders contribute to both sides, we&rsquo;ll hold both sides. Sometime it&rsquo;s hard to see which one is more valuable, but our position is to support the founders and create value for the project as a whole.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ella Zhang is not the first expert to predict a bubble burst. In April, Nobel Prize laureate for economics Robert Shiller <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nobel-winning-economist-shiller-says-bitcoin-bubble-may-be-around-for-a-while">pointed out that</a> while <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> might be a bubble, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it will burst and be gone forever. According to Shiller, there is a part of the cryptocurrency &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; that is political, as people who don&rsquo;t trust their governments may be tempted to invest.</p>\n</p>',

Otherwise, ideal entries for cautious traders should be above $650.</p>\n<h2>From the News</h2>\n<p>We cannot refute Ethereum possibilities. It did not only allow for wholesale tokenization but with smart contract, there is innovation and creation of new opportunities. While this has been revolutionizing, the limitation of throughput has been a major concern. A slow throughput inevitably leads to network congestion as more people utilize this platform. As it is Ethereum can handle a maximum of 15 TPS meaning it cannot compete with other networks as Tron who promises high throughput up-to 10,000 TPS for their DApp developers. This is the exact reason why Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum developers are hard at work searching for scaling and throughput solutions.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Ethereum</a> will eventually be able to process 1 million transactions per second and possibly more than 100 million per sec with second-layer solutions such as <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sharding?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Sharding</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Plasma?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Plasma</a>. This was revealed by Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, in a recent session with OmiseGo AMA <a href="https://t.co/asktsXuxx2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/asktsXuxx2</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; boxmining (@boxmining) <a href="https://twitter.com/boxmining/status/1003667882532892673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 4, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>So far, we have two proposals that are already in development: Sharding and Plasma. Hopefully, implementation of these two could lift all the Ethereum congestion and scalability problems. Sharding will deal with network congestion and proposes the splitting of the Ethereum network nodes into portions called shards. Each shard would handle certain transactions meaning on a quadratic proportion, the network can process thousands if not hundreds of thousands of transaction concurrently through these individual shards. This way, individual nodes won’t have to process each and every transaction that passes through its network as it is the case at the moment.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Plasma would specifically deal with network scalability. It has been a thorny issue and what most want to see is an infinitely scaling network. Plasma would be what Vitalik refers to as a second layer solution that entirely depends on the Ethereum blockchain solely for security. It do share some similarities with LN as both are off chain layers.</p>\n<h2>Ethereum Price Technical Analysis</h2>\n<h4>Weekly Chart</h4>\n<div id="attachment_334693" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-334693" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/04173253/Ethereum-Weekly-Chart-for-June-5.png" alt="Ethereum (ETH) Price Technical Analysis" width="1280" height="1024" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><strong><em>Ethereum Weekly Chart by Trading View</em></strong></a></p></div>\n<p>From a 6 month angle, we can say <a href="https://www.theglobalmail.org/btc-xrp-eth-bch-neo-price-analysis-june-4/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Ethereum prices are on a down trend</a>. And we cannot be further from the truth when we place a simple trend line between 2018 highs and April highs. The results are obvious. But that’s not the point because in the last two months for example, Ethereum buyers have been trying to make a comeback.</p>\n<p>In this chart for example we note that while May was bearish, it didn’t manage to fully reverse April gains. As such, we have a higher high if we connect April and May lows but what’s different is that May’s weekly candlesticks were low in volumes and pales in comparison with April market participation levels. Because of these interesting developments chances are we might see buyers building up from last week’s bullish candlestick and break above $650.</p>\n<h4>Daily Chart</h4>\n<div id="attachment_334692" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-334692" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/04173237/Ethereum-Daily-Chart-for-June-5.png" alt="Ethereum (ETH) Price Technical Analysis" width="1280" height="1024" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><strong><em>Ethereum Daily Chart by Trading View</em></strong></a></p></div>\n<p>Here we have nice series of higher highs and as expected, the correction we saw yesterday is but normal. In case you want to pick out perfect bull entries then zoom in to the 4HR chart. From there you can wait for reversals at around $550 minor support line. In the meantime though, traders can stay on the side lines. I only recommend entries when we see up-thrusts above $650. Coincidentally, this level happens to be above May 23 highs. Then again, note that May 23 was the beginning of a climactic sells. Fortunately for hodlers, bears slowed down on May 28 and from there prices begun bottoming out.</p>\n</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/05/ethereum-eth-price-technical-analysis-june-5-2018/" data-wpel-link="internal">Vitalik&#8217;s Sharding and Plasma is Justin Sun&#8217;s 10,000 TPS Checkmate: Ethereum (ETH) Price Technical Analysis (June 5, 2018)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com" data-wpel-link="internal">NewsBTC</a>.</p>',

We place those levels at 5.5 cents for Tron which is racing lower and complementing the previous week’s bear move as it completely negate our expectations.</p>\n<p>Let’s have a look at the charts:</p>\n<h2>EOS Price Technical Analysis</h2>\n<div id="attachment_334697" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-334697" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/04174139/EOS-Daily-Chart-for-June-5.png" alt="EOS Price Technical Analysis" width="1280" height="1024" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EOSUSD/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><strong><em>EOS Daily Chart by Trading View</em></strong></a></p></div>\n<p>The influence of whaling is playing out in EOS. Why? Well, solid data reveals that 10 addresses holds up-to 50 percent of EOS coin supply. That’s 500 Million EOS coins under 10 addresses of which Block One is one of the biggest hodlers. It’s ridiculous because aside from raising $4 billion from their one year long crowd funding, they hold an additional 100 million EOS coins.</p>\n<p>This gifts them an extra $1.5 billion if we make deductions from spot USD rates. In the top 10 list, the least address has 20.39 million EOS coins and the rest which many believe to be exchanges controls upwards of 150 million EOS coins. That’s not all. When it comes to “decentralization”, the top 1000 addresses control 86 percent of the total supply meaning when it comes to voting and governance, your vote won’t be influential as you have been made to think.</p>\n<p>When it comes to price action, we shall <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/04/tron-iota-eos-stellar-litecoin-price-technical-analysis-june-4-2018/" data-wpel-link="internal">retain our bullish projection</a> but in this case of long covering, bears might continue pushing EOS prices lower. In this regard, June 2 bullish candlestick would act as a minor resistance and support in the days to come. After all, volumes are low and pales in comparison to June 2 price action. As such, if you want perfect long entries then wait until bears test $12 or there about. Thereafter enter in the 4HR chart whenever a strong bullish candlestick prints.</p>\n<h2>Litecoin (LTC) Price Technical Analysis</h2>\n<div id="attachment_334699" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-334699" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/04174213/Litecoin-Daily-Chart-for-June-5.png" alt="Litecoin (LTC) Price Technical Analyis" width="1280" height="1024" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><strong><em>Litecoin Daily Chart by Trading View</em></strong></a></p></div>\n<p>Charlie Lee brother thinks blockchain is not what the worlds need as every user input is subjective as network consensus dictates. In an interview with CNBC, Bobby Lee came to this conclusion after “thinking very hard” about the whole protocol thing.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/controversial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#controversial</a> interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptomanran?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@cryptomanran</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Berlin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Berlin</a> this past week:</p>\n<p>A TRUE <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Blockchain?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Blockchain</a> cannot be used for Real World applications, as everything we see &amp; measure is subjective (and contentious) by nature, and thus CANNOT be written in objectively!<a href="https://t.co/z9mdVRTYW4" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/z9mdVRTYW4</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Bobby Lee (@bobbyclee) <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyclee/status/1002959522065874944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 2, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>He eventually deduced that real world businesses need a central database and not a blockchain arrangement as many ICOs model their businesses around. In his view, every measurement is contentious and some private data require a central data base where there is absolute control and verification.</p>\n<p>Following yesterday’s rejection of higher prices and collapse, odds are we may see a follow through today. Our analysis will anchor on June 3 candlestick which had high volumes but price oscillations were within a tight range. This “subtle” rejection of higher highs came to pass with yesterday’s candlestick. Because of this technical development, potential support lies between $110 and $115. That range would be an ideal zones buyers in the 4HR chart. If not and this applies to conservatives, Litecoin buyers must have to wait for close above $130 as we have been insisting in previous trade plans.</p>\n<h2>Stellar Lumens (XLM) Price Technical Analysis</h2>\n<div id="attachment_334700" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-334700" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/04174229/Stellar-Lumens-Daily-Chart-for-June-5.png" alt="Stellar Lumens (XLM) Price Technical Analysis" width="1280" height="1024" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XLMUSD/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><strong><em>Stellar Lumens Daily Chart by Trading View</em></strong></a></p></div>\n<p>Week over week, <a href="https://coinlib.io/coin/XLM/Stellar" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Stellar prices are up 10 percent</a> but in the last 24 hours, they are down five percent. Most notably though is the high volume injection visible in yesterday’s double bar bearish reversal pattern. As a confirmation of those spike in market participation, Stellar Lumens sellers may end up dominating price action today. In that case and in respect to last week’s bullish pattern, immediate support and possible reaction point would be at 25 cents on the lower edge and 27 cents if this correction is not very deep.</p>\n<h2>Tron (TRX) Price Technical Analysis</h2>\n<div id="attachment_334701" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-334701" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/04174244/Tron-Daily-Chart-for-June-5.png" alt="Tron (TRX) Price Technical Analysis" width="1280" height="1024" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TRXUSD/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><strong><em>Tron Daily Chart by Trading View</em></strong></a></p></div>\n<p>The robustness and security of any network supersedes all other incentives. That’s why the Tron Foundation is concentrating all their effort in ensuring the network is above all secure. Through Project Genesis which was set rolling sometimes back in April, developers have a way of taking part in network secure and getting rewards in the process.</p>\n<p>Besides, there is a bounty reward program where white hackers would receive $100,000 for every bug they discover and an irresistible loan program for Ethereum DApp developers wishing to build their apps using Tron’s VM. These are measures that are in place before their full migration by June 2018. Later on in September they shall schedule a convention and a Hackaton to further scrutinize the network.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EOS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#EOS</a> Global <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hackaton?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Hackaton</a> &#8211; June 2018 &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AreYouReady?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#AreYouReady</a> ? <a href="https://twitter.com/go_eos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@go_eos</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EOS_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@EOS_io</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanBlumer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@BrendanBlumer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/bytemaster7?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@bytemaster7</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/brockpierce?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@brockpierce</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/eosforumorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@eosforumorg</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/eosnewyork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@eosnewyork</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/eos_la?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@eos_la</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/eosphere_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@eosphere_io</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EOSNordics?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@EOSNordics</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EosArgentina?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@EosArgentina</a> @EosRussia <a href="https://twitter.com/eosatlanta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@eosatlanta</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/goeosgo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#goeosgo</a> <a href="https://t.co/9w4VIIVMPE" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/9w4VIIVMPE</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; EOS Italy &#8211; The 1st <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f1ee-1f1f9.png" alt="🇮🇹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Community (@EOS_Italy) <a href="https://twitter.com/EOS_Italy/status/972416848888258560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">March 10, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>While measures are in place to ensure network integrity, prices are printing lower lows.

Of course, as a cryptocurrency user, this is a fact that cannot be ignored, and I can say I&rsquo;m more than thrilled to get to know about it. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes!</p>\n<h3>University Blockchain Research Initiative</h3>\n<p>Under the name of &ldquo;<em>University Blockchain Research Initiative,</em>&rdquo; <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ripple-xrp-expect-the-bull-to-visit-shortly/">Ripple</a> has created a program that seeks to boost the adoption of the blockchain technologies. At least $50 million will be donated to the program, and the company has already clarified that the donation will be in actual dollars and not crypto.</p>\n<p>According to declarations made by the Senior Vice President of the company,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanmiltenburg">Eric van Miltenburg</a>, the initiative surged from an astonishing increase in the demand of jobs related to the blockchain. Miltenburg stated that this year alone at least 4,500 jobs were published with the words &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; or &ldquo;cryptocurrencies&rdquo; on the social network LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Besides noting this represents an increase of <em>150 percent</em> compared to the offers in the site that involved such terms last year, he continued and said that this is a natural thing to happen as every time we live in a more globalized environment where the demand of technological solutions every day increases, a fact of which the blockchain would not be the exception.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s recall that the blockchain is the technology that serves as the conductor for what we know as virtual coins or cryptocurrencies. In fact, <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ripple-ceo-bitcoin-dominance-about-to-end/">Ripple</a> is a company related to the sector specifically through products that seek to improve real-time operations for financial entities.</p>\n<p>The company possesses its very own cryptocurrency dubbed <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/why-ripple-xrp-is-good-investment-under-zero-point-75-usd/">XRP</a>, a coin that currently is ranked as the number 3 of the market by the market capitalization tracker site Coinmarketcap. Although the primary purpose of the program is not to enhance the usage or performance of the digital coin of <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/4-strategic-alliances-can-shoot-ripple-xrp-moon/">Ripple</a>, the company specified that some universities involved in the study would use the products of Ripple and most likely the XRP token.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This initiative represents without a doubt a very positive thing for the cryptocurrency industry. Even when the purpose is not to promote the usage of cryptocurrencies, it still is an excellent approach as it will give the opportunity to interact with the technology behind such financial forms.</p>\n<p>This can definitely be the start of a very good time for <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ripple-xrp-3-mark-2018/">Ripple (XRP)</a>, which despite being the number 3 of the market as of the moment has had one of the worst performances of the sector <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ripple-q1-report-2018-how-well-the-xrp-performed/">on 2018</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Various tokens and coins following up on the list by market capitalization are created on Ethereum&#8217;s network. Many other blockchains that support smart contracts have been coming up but Ethereum still is the go-to platform for tokens and decentralized applications.</p>\n<p>Ethereum (ETH), the second-ranked cryptocurrency has now overtaken Bitcoin (BTC) based on the number of unique addresses. While this stat does not in itself tell the full story, another surprising statistic has emerged. Ethereum has for the first time surpassed Bitcoin in the number of active addresses.</p>\n<p>The 35 million unique ETH addresses are representing 100% increase since end of 2017. The second-ranked crypto based on market cap is reportedly adding an average of 100,000 addresses per day.</p>\n<p>Keeping in mind that ETH wallets re-use addresses while BTC wallets do not, we can conclude that there is more cryptocurrency activity around Ethereum than Bitcoin.</p>\n<h3>ETH/USD</h3>\n<p>Ethereum (ETH) price was affected by the volatility in the market during the Q1 of 2018. ETH/USD plummeted to trade below $360 on April 1. The cryptocurrency, however, battled shaking off the bear pressure through the month of April. Ethereum price traded highs of $829 in the first week of May before the current bear trend took over.</p>\n<p>A week ago, the pair ETH/USD deep-dived below the $560.00 to test the $500.00. Despite that after making it above the $600.00, the token price dropped to $593.00 per time of writing &#8211; Ethereum still has strong potential to go beyond $1,000.00 this year.</p>\n<p>There have been bullish predictions from experts, besides it has shown that it has the ability to recover after severe downside movements in the market.</p>\n<p><a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Untitled.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12306" src="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Untitled.jpg" alt="Ethereum" width="814" height="590" srcset="https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Untitled.jpg 814w, https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Untitled-300x217.jpg 300w, https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Untitled-768x557.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /></a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/cryptocurrency-recommendation-ethereum-eth-choices/">Cryptocurrency Recommendation: Ethereum (ETH) under Best Choices</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ethereumworldnews.com">Ethereum World News</a>.</p>',

In a tweet to the community, the IOTA team announced that project Qubic will enable IOTA gain unlimited use cases, and turn IOTA into one stop solution. The tweet read as follows,</p>\n</p>\n<p>So why is this a big deal for IOTA (MIOTA) investors? Well, IOTA (MIOTA) is one of the strongest crypto projects in the market, because it is everything that most blockchains can only wish for. &nbsp;For instance, while bitcoin and most other cryptos struggle with issues like transaction costs and scalability, IOTA (MIOTA) offers feeless transactions at unrivalled speeds. That&rsquo;s why it has constantly been labelled as the blockchain killer. This also explains why it is getting adopted in futuristic projects that will define the 21<sup>st</sup> century. For instance, it was adopted by Taipei city in the development of a futuristic smart city. It has seen adoption in the smart car industry in the recharging of electric cars. That&rsquo;s huge and points to the potential of IOTA (MIOTA) to become an integral part of the 21<sup>st</sup> digital economy.</p>\n<p>Now with Qubic, IOTA is taking the game a notch higher, by acquiring smart contracts capabilities.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because it will have the same capabilities as Ethereum and all other smart contract blockchains in the market. However, it has one edge over them all, and that&rsquo;s the fact that it is faster, cheaper and more scalable than them all. At the moment, Ethereum is struggling with scalability and transaction speeds, which is a major hindrance for its mass adoption. With Qubic, IOTA (MIOTA) now has the capacity to offer the same smart contracts capabilities, but in an infinitely scalable environment that is also superfast and feeless. There is absolutely no reason why Dapps developers would choose Ethereum, NEO or any of the other platform blockchains in the market, when they can get a way better deal with IOTA (MIOTA).</p>\n<p>In essence, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before IOTA (MIOTA) takes over, not just the digital payments economy and dethrone the likes of bitcoin and Litecoin, but the Dapps smart economy as well.</p>\n<p>With such huge and endless possibilities, why isn&rsquo;t IOTA (MIOTA) shooting up? If anything, it has dropped in value since the announcement was made! Well first, there is an element of profit-taking to it.&nbsp; While project Qubic has been in the works for years, the IOTA (MIOTA) team first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOM_SCCblrA">revealed it about a month ago</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, the community has been eagerly waiting for it, and this led to a surge in price all through the month. That&rsquo;s why when the news finally came out, there was a sell off. It&rsquo;s a classic case of buying the rumor and selling the news.&nbsp; Second, the entire crypto market has started the week low, after the ZenCash <a href="https://cryptorecorder.com/?s=51%25">51% attack</a>. This has affected the short-term value of IOTA (MIOTA).</p>\n<p>The good thing is that these are short-term issues that have no bearing on the future of IOTA (MIOTA).&nbsp; Once developers start creating smart contracts on IOTA, it will be huge! It could even go higher than $10 this year. Invest in IOTA (MIOTA) with a long-term view.</p>\n<div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled">\n<div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing"></div>\n</div>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://cryptorecorder.com/2018/06/04/iota-miota-project-qubic-makes-10-possible-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IOTA (MIOTA) &ndash; Project Qubic makes $10 possible in 2018</a> was originally published on <a href="https://cryptorecorder.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cryptorecorder.com/</a>.

According to the company&rsquo;s website, the app is currently under beta testing and will be available for download in Q2 2018.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Smart contracts and shared space capacity</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">&quot;Triwer has built in a number of unique selling points which we believe will make Triwer an industry online standard in much the same way as Uber in the private taxi sector or AirBnB in short term property rentals&quot;, Triwer&#39;s white paper says.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The core idea of the Triwer App is that it will automatically select the most appropriate and best value delivery route, including multi-carrier options by means of a multi-party smart contract. In particular, such a smart contract may include insurance and will be recorded on the main blockchain but with constituent parts, processes and obligations transferred to a sidechain.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain</a> management platform will allow smart contracting, delivery management, tracking, escrow and payment. According to the project&rsquo;s &nbsp;white paper, the smart contract will unify tracking across the sidechain, as the package is booked in and out of key waypoints and transfers between carriers, until the final mile delivery is ready for dispatch through a Triwer crowd delivery driver. Upon confirmation of receipt the contract is concluded, the completion is recorded on the main blockchain, and payment distributed to each constituent of the contract.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">One of the project&#39;s features is sharing spare capacity and using resources that are already making a similar journey and improving efficiency. According to Triwer team, that scheme will reduce emission on duplicated journeys, and eventually will have significant effect on traffic congestion.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Sales will focus on signing up small to medium sized e-commerce sites and attracting their customers to install the Triwer app through various promotions and incentives in order to channel deliveries through the Triwer network, says the white paper.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Conquering the market</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">According to the project&#39;s white paper, Triwer aims to take a significant share of the European courier express and parcel market through acceptance of its automated DLT (distributed leger technology) platform and TRW token.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;All transactions with the main or side blockchain must be electronic and hence Triwer&rsquo;s encrypted electronic token the TRW will be the operating currency across the platform&rdquo;, says the text of the paper. Triwer will organize wallets for all main counter-parties and stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The app will also incorporate an automated exchange application, such as &lsquo;Coinify&rsquo;, that automatically transfers fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies into TRW to transact along the smart contract.</p>\n\n<p>Triwer has launched its crowdfunding campaign on June 1, 2018. The public token sale will remain open until June 30, 2018. The soft cap is $5 mln, and the hard cap is $25 mln. 1 TRW coin equals to $0.08.

Mid-December searches for Bitcoin were recorded at 100 out of a scale of 100. However, fast-forward six months later and Google Trends show that number at 10, a drop of 90 percent. From January, when results were pegged at 44, the decline in interest is over 75 percent.</p>\n<p>Notably, the results highlight that this time last year low figures for Bitcoin searches were recorded in June as well.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-334727 size-full" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/04191500/Google-Trends.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="541" /></p>\n<p>According to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, this drop in interest is not a good sign for crypto prices, reports <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/google-searches-for-bitcoin-nosedive-75-percent-this-year.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">CNBC</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We use Google Trends to track search queries for &#8216;bitcoin&#8217; as a proxy for potential new buyers,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since the beginning of the year the number one digital currency has dropped in value by over 55 percent, and is currently trading at over $7,500, according to CoinMarketCap. Interestingly, while Colas admits that the company loves the idea of the cryptocurrency, he adds that his team are not fans of purchasing it at current levels.</p>\n<p>Others, however, think that now is the perfect time to invest in the market.</p>\n<p>Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital Management, a hedge fund company focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, was reported at the beginning of the month as saying that Bitcoin&#8217;s value may have reached a bottom, and that now is the time to buy.</p>\n<p>The founder of the San Francisco-based company said on CNBC&#8217;s &#8216;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/buy-bitcoin-now-while-its-still-cheap-says-cryptocurrency-investor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Fast Money</a>&#8216; that &#8216;all cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now. It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.&#8217; Back in April, Morehead also said that the worst could be over for the digital currency. He said then that was a good time to purchase Bitcoin, calling it a &#8216;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/27/pantera-fund-ceo-calls-bitcoin-screaming-buy-highly-optimsitic/" data-wpel-link="internal">screaming buy</a>&#8216; when it was valued around $6,600.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just Bitcoin, though, that is feeling the brunt of disinterestedness from potential new traders. Google searches for other major cryptocurrencies have also declined. Ethereum is down by 85 percent since the beginning of the year; Ripple has dropped by 91 percent; and Bitcoin Cash has experienced a decline of 80 percent.</p>\n<pre>Featured image from Shutterstock.</pre>\n</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/04/bitcoin-interest-drops-90-percent-from-december-google-trends/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin Interest Drops 90 Percent from December, Google Trends</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com" data-wpel-link="internal">NewsBTC</a>.</p>',

In<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-global-currency.html"> a recent interview with CNBC</a>, the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin<a data-original-title="" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/twitter-and-squares-jack-dorsey-bitcoin-will-be-worlds-single-currency/"> will become a unifying cryptocurrency</a> for every nation within the next 10 years.</p><p></p><p>“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.” </p><p>Wozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked. </p><p>He also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna,<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/montymunford/2018/05/18/apples-steve-wozniak-dumps-facebook-and-thinks-ethereum-could-be-the-new-apple/#63c64c1f3de5"> Wozniak praised Ethereum</a> and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.” </p><p>“Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed. </p><p>Wozniak now refers to bitcoin as “pure” and says it’s the true equivalent of digital gold. </p><p>“Bitcoin is mathematically defined,” he explained, “there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running it, there’s no company running it, and it’s just going and going, and growing and growing, and surviving. That, to me, says something that is natural, and nature is more important than all our human conventions.” </p><p>This is<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-global-currency-apple-steve-wozniak-cryptocurrency-a8383036.html"> not the first time Wozniak</a> has been vocally positive about bitcoin.

        content: '<img alt="Woz BTC" height="488" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/BitcoinApple.width-800.jpg" width="800"> <br/>\n\n           \n\n            <div class="rich-text"><p>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has some very positive things to say about bitcoin. In<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-global-currency.html"> a recent interview with CNBC</a>, the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin<a data-original-title="" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/twitter-and-squares-jack-dorsey-bitcoin-will-be-worlds-single-currency/"> will become a unifying cryptocurrency</a> for every nation within the next 10 years.</p><p></p><p>“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.” </p><p>Wozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked. </p><p>He also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna,<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/montymunford/2018/05/18/apples-steve-wozniak-dumps-facebook-and-thinks-ethereum-could-be-the-new-apple/#63c64c1f3de5"> Wozniak praised Ethereum</a> and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.” </p><p>“Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed. </p><p>Wozniak now refers to bitcoin as “pure” and says it’s the true equivalent of digital gold. </p><p>“Bitcoin is mathematically defined,” he explained, “there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running it, there’s no company running it, and it’s just going and going, and growing and growing, and surviving. That, to me, says something that is natural, and nature is more important than all our human conventions.” </p><p>This is<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-global-currency-apple-steve-wozniak-cryptocurrency-a8383036.html"> not the first time Wozniak</a> has been vocally positive about bitcoin.

Szczepanik has been named Senior Advisor for Digital Assets, as well as Associate Director of the Division of Corporation Finance. She will be tasked with &ldquo;coordinat[ing] efforts across all SEC Divisions and Offices regarding the application of U.S. securities laws to emerging digital asset technologies and innovations, including <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ico">Initial Coin Offerings</a> (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Formerly the head of the SEC&rsquo;s distributed ledger group, Szczepanik recently participated in the Consensus blockchain conference in New York, and was <a  href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-blockchain-idUSKBN18K05Q" rel="nofollow,noopener"  target="_blank">quoted</a> as saying that &ldquo;if you want [the crypto] industry to flourish, protection of investors should be at the forefront.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">In her official statement today, Szczepanik struck a similar note, saying she would use the new role &ldquo;to facilitate capital formation, promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and protect investors, particularly Main Street investors.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">In his response to today&rsquo;s appointment, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said that Szczepanik was &ldquo;the right person to coordinate our efforts in this dynamic area that has both promise and risk.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The SEC considers <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-cftc-irs-and-others-a-guide-to-us-regulating-bodies">cryptocurrencies to be securities</a>, which brings them under the purview of its jurisdiction. According to the 70 year old <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ico-goes-extra-mile-to-protect-contributors">Howey Test</a>, a security involves the investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others&#39; efforts.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">During February&rsquo;s US SEC and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cftc">CFTC</a> senate <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-and-cftc-hearing-more-legitimate-icos-or-if-there-was-no-bitcoin-there-would-be-no-blockchain">hearing</a>, Chairman Clayton stressed that while every ICO token the SEC has seen so far is considered a security, a distinction should be made between tokens and major cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum</a>. The latter has reportedly <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wsj-eth-now-in-a-gray-zone-but-2014-ico-was-likely-an-illegal-securities-sale">been a subject</a> of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-foundation-extremely-comfortable-eth-is-not-a-security-co-founder-lubin-says">debate</a> among US regulators, some of whom contend that Ethereum is a security. Were such a determination to be made, its 2014 ICO would constitute an unregistered security offering.</p>\n\n<p>The SEC continues to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-ico-market-is-example-of-unregulated-securities-market-says-sec-commissioner">raise concerns about ICOs</a>, conducting a <a  href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-launches-cryptocurrency-probe-1519856266?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1" rel="nofollow,noopener"  target="_blank">sweeping probe</a> in February 2018, in which it issued subpoenas to force the closure of a number of &ldquo;unregistered securities&rdquo; in the ICO space. Most recently, the organization has concentrated its efforts on educating investors about potential risks, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-launches-mock-ico-to-show-investors-warning-signs-of-fraud">creating</a> a website for a fake ICO that was designed to imitate the classic &ldquo;red flags&rdquo; of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-ico-market-is-example-of-unregulated-securities-market-says-sec-commissioner">fraudulent</a> token sales.</p>\n</p>',

Source: <a title="" href="https://aeonminingpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>aeonminingpool</i></a></p>\n<p>But the fork looks to be successful for now, with blocks still being mined and no chain re-organizations as of yet. The chart above shows how the network hashrate has declined massively from around 140MH/s to a low near 1MH/s and recovered slightly to 10 MH/s at the time of writing as more miners come back online and take advantage of the more favorable profitability. By June 5, the difficulty should have stopped fluctuating so much and blocks should be mined on a more even basis.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the coins that are not widely used on exchanges, like AEON, are relatively safe from these 51 percent attacks we have seen like on <a title="" href="https://twitter.com/zencashofficial/status/1003275809149288450" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZenCash</a>. On the other hand, Electroneum is mining empty blocks after forking, and at one point, there were concerns that <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/8ewgla/en_update_scheduled_for_may_30th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if AEON forked after Electroneum</a>, the former would be more vulnerable to ASICs and malicious attacks as both use a similar algorithm (CryptoNight).</p>\n<h2>‘Sophia’ Release: Just in Time</h2>\n<p>In early May, Katiecharm, one of the figures instrumental behind the rebase of AEON and reviving momentum in the coin, <a title="" href="https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9085162" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that the altcoin is a possible target for a 51 percent attack:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“Yes, Aeon is under high threat of 51 percent in general. If there is enough of a financial incentive out there, then it will happen. We can&#8217;t just hope it doesn&#8217;t.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The state of affairs was depressing for many AEON holders with no definite deadline initially. The negative sentiment was <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/8hp6wx/whatever_happened_to_the_aeon_roadmap/dyljavb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made clear by one miner</a> during the wait for the upgrade to nullify ASICs, “Blindly waiting for the developers to drop some info on us is tiring and frustrating, especially when mining has lost its incentive. I’ll keep mining, hoping the rebase happens and we get rid of those asics but if nothing changes I’ll probably find something else to mine.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the concerns about ASICs did not fall on deaf ears, and on May 24, a new client was released named ‘<a title="" href="https://github.com/aeonix/aeon-gui/releases/tag/v0.12.0.0-aeon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophia</a>,’ which implemented the rebase and set the stage for the June 3 fork to nullify ASICs.</p>\n<p>The June 3 fork of AEON, which included a difficulty reset to mitigate the large reduction in hashrate expected, has galvanized the community and improved sentiment. The time needed for careful and meticulous testing of the new software had a handful of miners and community members worried, but the developers pulled through in the end, with help from Monero developers stoffu and moneromoo.</p>\n<p>On June 4, it is clear that miners are beginning to return, as evidenced by a positive <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/8ofa7g/look_at_the_hashrate_drop_yes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit post</a> celebrating the fork and the increasing hashrate following June 3, as displayed previously.</p>\n<p>Despite the difficulties faced, namely project management and communication with the community, the developers delivered. Despite the success, the events that transpired go to show how coordination problems can cause problems for decentralized projects.</p>\n<p>During the past couple months, the community was tense, and some members even questioned smooth’s and developer&#8217;s intentions, but it seems the trust in them has been well placed; but trusting or relying on someone is something that the AEON community does not want to engage in again.</p>\n<h3>What Doesn’t Kill a Project Makes it Stronger?</h3>\n<p>The series of events did reveal at least one flaw in the decentralized project; being too reliant on one, two or a handful of actors. While the developers delivered, some in the AEON community raised concerns as to what would be the path forward if smooth were to disappear suddenly, or something bad happened to the developer.</p>\n<p>For instance, aeonminingpool <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/8jpngh/logs_irc_meeting_tuesday_may_15th_2018_2pm_pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> their concern in a meeting on May 15, “Smooth &#8211; it&#8217;s best more individuals have access [to the GitHub repo] just for good governance. Nothing more and nothing personal said or implied. You can nominate people whom you deem reliable as well. No one would object I&#8217;m sure.” Katiecharm replied that the community should discuss this topic and smooth approved of the request, that is opening up access to the GitHub repo, so it is not accessible to just one person.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, one Reddit user stated in response to the announcement of ‘Sophia’ &#8211; the software client that would be compatible with the tweaked CryptoNight-lite ASIC resistant algorithm &#8211; that his vocal, long-running concerns about long block times, as experienced by <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/moneros-scheduled-upgrade-to-soon-reveal-the-extent-of-secretive-asic-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monero in April</a>, were ignored initially. The user went onto state how AEON can improve:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“If we can have a more open and expansive view of the crypto marketplace I am sure similar problems will be seen and addressed in a more timely and effective manner.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More frequent communication and better organization is needed for the project to remain relevant and reach its true potential, where developer meetings held on a regular basis were highlighted as one positive step forward. With one major update behind AEON and miners in a better position to mine the <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/news/altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">altcoin</a> profitably, things are looking up, and the path forward now must be forged to inspire confidence in the project.</p>\n<p>With more exchange listings, an aeon pool league, initiatives to incentivize solo mining <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/7n3ycf/aeon_social_roadmap_v01_december_17_edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the agenda since December 2017</a>, as well as improving exposure and merchant adoption, the AEON project is now set to make some solid progress toward these objectives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>Disclaimer: The author has a small holding of AEON, as well as other altcoins. Please do your own research when investing in cryptocurrencies, as they can be risky investments. The author is comfortable with his losses if AEON ever becomes worthless. </i></p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com/the-long-and-winding-road-aeon-follows-moneros-lead-to-nullify-asics/">The Long and Winding Road: AEON Follows Monero&#8217;s Lead to Nullify ASICs</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com">BTCMANAGER</a>.</p>',

A big step for Tron, Odyssey 2.0 has already accumulated over 2,000 revisions, released 15 software iterations, merged over 500 forks, and added more than 100 new features. Users can download Odyssey 2.0 from Tron <a href="https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/releases">Github page</a>.</p>\n<p>25<sup>th</sup> June also referred to as &ldquo;Independence Day&rdquo; has been scheduled to be the date where the network is going to migrate from Ethereum&rsquo;s platform fully. Regarding logical challenges, the <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-tron-erc20-migration-affect-on-ethereum/">shift from Ethereum&rsquo;s ERC-20</a> to Tron&rsquo;s native new token will require holders to convert their existing TRX altcoins into the new form and ensure their tokens is in a supported wallet and exchange.

This questions the apparent decentralization that the token boasts.</p>\n<p>The data in question was uncovered by user Lannisan on Reddit. The post titled &ldquo;EOS Rich List/Genesis Snapshot Statistics&rdquo; crunched the numbers associated with the genesis snapshot results. There was also a disclaimer along with the post that pointed out that some of the bigger wallets may belong to exchanges, but the data still holds disturbing conclusions.</p>\n<p>He went on to state the criteria to enter the top 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 richest EOS holders. The tokens to be held are 20.6 million, 646 thousand, 42 thousand, 3000 and 55 respectively.</p>\n<p>After the data was processed, it turned out that the top 10 held a whopping 496 million tokens of the 1 billion tokens in existence. This is reflective of real world wealth distribution, where 1% of individuals possess 40% of the wealth. The company behind the EOS platform, Block.one holds 10% of all tokens in existence, which left the data excluding Block.one at 39.6% of all tokens held by the top 10.</p>\n<p>The top 100 held 64.82% of all the tokens, which is still a sizeable margin over the top 10. The margin comes up to 25.22%. The top 1000 were abysmal by comparison held over only 75.81%. This translates to a margin of just under 11%. The remaining holders hold only 13.86% of all available. The remaining 0.33% are left unregistered.</p>\n<p>The final break up comes up to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Block.one &#8211; 10%.</li>\n<li>2-1000 &#8211; 75.81%.</li>\n<li>1001-163,920 &#8211; 13.86%.</li>\n<li>Unregistered &#8211; 0.33%.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>He ended the post with:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those Top 1000 holders are quite powerful indeed. The Top 10 alone can almost do whatever they want if all 10 of them agree to do the same thing since they control almost 50% of the total EOS (and no one would be able to stop them). And whoever is in the Top 1000 will also have a lot of influence.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Commenters speculated that the top wallets might not be exchanges, but instead shadow accounts of Dan Larimer.</p>\n<p>User XRballer said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not all exchanges. Several are Dan and his father&#8217;s shadow accounts. They have been buying EOS with ICO Eth all year and storing it in a collection of 100s of wallets. They need to keep majority control over the supply to prevent other cartels from taking over.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>User gallge said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This should simply read YOU ARE F****D.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com/eos-not-decentralized-50-eos-tokens-belong-top-10-holders/">EOS is not decentralized? 50% of EOS tokens belong to top 10 holders</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com">AMBCrypto</a>.</p>',

        content: '<p>Blockchain technology continues to adapt and evolve to suit the demands of its growing user base.  From the original Bitcoin protocols, it has evolved into the 2nd generation Ethereum platform, and today we are in the process of building the 3rd generation of blockchains. The technology has progressed from a simple distributed database into a more powerful distributed based computer. But where is it going?</p>\n<p>The first blockchain was thought up in 2008 by the anonymous developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto. This technology gave Bitcoin its engine, which became the first digital currency to solve the problems associated with requiring a central server, or trusted authority, to regulate the transactions.</p>\n<p>Since then it has been recognized that the distributed ledger technology can have many uses beyond digital currencies and can be used for tracking and recording the trade of anything valuable.  The Bitcoin design has been inspirational, acting as a large-scale proof of concept.</p>\n<h2><strong>Second Generation Blockchain</strong></h2>\n<p>Within just a few years of the genesis of blockchain technology, there was an evolutionary jump as the 2nd generation emerged. This 2nd gen technology was designed as a network for developers to build applications on. This is where the evolution of the technology allowed blockchain to become a distributed virtual computer, which was made possible by the developments associated with the Ethereum platform which is an open source, public blockchain distributed computer platform featuring smart contract functionality.</p>\n<p>This new virtual machine, which went live in 2015, runs computer programs using a global network of computers. The goal of this technology was for the express purpose of building distributed applications. So far, the system has been very successful at getting the attention of a large and growing community of developers, supporters, and enterprises who continue to push the evolution and development of this new technology.</p>\n<p>The most important contribution of this system, as the second generation of blockchain technology, is that it has brought the system up from being primarily used as relatively simple distributed database used as the platform for Bitcoin, to a much more evolved and useful distributed computing platform designed for running decentralized applications and smart contracts.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5179" src="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1.png" alt="blockchain revolution" width="1000" height="493" srcset="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1.png 1000w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-300x148.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-768x379.png 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-550x271.png 550w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-520x256.png 520w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-625x308.png 625w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-15x7.png 15w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-999x493.png 999w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-854x421.png 854w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>\n<p>Right now, Ethereum is the most popular and viable platform for building applications on.  Many types of applications have been built on this foundation already, from popular social networks to financial applications.</p>\n<p>Ethereum has been a major step forward, and with its success has given us a look into the future of what is possible to achieve with blockchain.  It seems that this technology will soon become a massive, globally distributed cloud computing platform for which we will be able to run applications of any type, and at the same scale and speed as today’s major websites.  All with the security assurances of today’s blockchains.</p>\n<p>However, right now these new platforms are more like extremely inefficient computers that don’t do much except proving concepts. Getting to the next link in the evolutionary chain will involve some serious mathematical problem solving not for the faint of heart.  The ability to handle high volume transactional workloads remain at the heart of the problem and what this 3<sup>rd</sup> generation of blockchains are currently trying to solve.</p>\n<p>Keeping the transaction ledgers current to support Bitcoin transactions uses more energy than some small countries.  Currently, the consumption of power equals that of Denmark, and costs over a billion and a half dollars a year.  Most of this consumption is being fueled by cheap, dirty, energy sources in China, which is where about 60% of the transaction mining happens. Using this much energy is simply not viable for obvious reasons, especially as these networks continue to grow.</p>\n<p>Technical wizardry and monetary incentives to maintain the accuracy and records of who owns what, without a centralized authority controlling the whole thing is how it’s done today.  The problem is that it’s difficult to maintain this balancing act while also trying to grow the number of users using the system. Currently, blockchain requires a global consensus on the order and outcome of all transfers, which is what gives the technology its unique ability to police itself with high assurances of accuracy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Transactions</strong></h2>\n<p>In Ethereum, all transactions are stored publicly on every node of the blockchain, which has its downside as well as its upside. The downside is that performance slows down because every computer handling transactions has to calculate all of them in real time. The reason for this is that it is clearly a cumbersome task that sees the total number of transactions increasing every 10 to 12 seconds with each new block added.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5180" src="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume.png" alt="bitcoin volume" width="1000" height="602" srcset="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume.png 1000w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-300x181.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-768x462.png 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-550x331.png 550w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-520x313.png 520w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-625x376.png 625w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-15x9.png 15w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-999x602.png 999w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-volume-854x514.png 854w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>\n<p>The volume of transactions is also an existing constraint of the system.  With cryptocurrency, transaction speed is calculated by measuring the number of transactions per second that can be handled. The Bitcoin network’s capacity, theoretically, is somewhere around seven transactions per second, while Ethereum blockchains run about twice as many.</p>\n<p>Comparatively, a credit card network is typically able to handle over 20,000 transactions per second. Facebook, might have about close to a million users on their site at any given moment, can handle about 175,000 requests for action per second.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cost</strong></h2>\n<p>Another major issue is that this is all pretty expensive.  The fact is that it costs a good deal of coins to pay the data miners for maintaining the ledger, and the system we have now is only ok for a limited amount of large transactions. However, using the blockchain to make small purchases, like a cup of coffee at Starbucks would currently not be possible, because, in their current form, they simply can’t handle a large number of small transactions such as what would be needed to handle high-volume exchanges like what you would find typically at most places like grocery stores, restaurants, and coffee shops.</p>\n<p>Attempting these types of transactions would be, under the current system, entirely too expensive.  Looking into the future, it is easy to see how people will want to use the blockchain for these types of transactions.  Currently under development, many different companies are now laboring to put together a next-generation blockchain infrastructure, with each organization experimenting with different methods to try and eliminate existing problems with the system.</p>\n<h2><strong>Moving Blockchain Into the Future</strong></h2>\n<p>One of these networks is the Lightning Network, which is trying to extend the capacity of existing blockchains.  Their idea is that small, insignificant transactions, like your cup of coffee, will not have to be stored on the main blockchain, which is known as an “off-chain” approach. It works by creating small subnetworks where many smaller transactions can take place without each of those transactions needing to be recorded on the main ledger. A payment network channel is opened up between a group of people. The money the network represents is then frozen on the main blockchain.  Those members can then transact with one another using their private keys to validate their transactions.</p>\n<p>This is a bit like having a bar tab, and the exchanges are marked down without making a log on the main blockchain, and then, at a designated point, the sum of those transactions is logged and the ledger is updated.  This only requires a couple transactions on the main ledger.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5181" src="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology.png" alt="blockchain technology" width="1000" height="579" srcset="https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology.png 1000w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-300x174.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-768x445.png 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-550x318.png 550w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-520x301.png 520w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-625x362.png 625w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-15x9.png 15w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-999x579.png 999w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blockchain-technology-854x494.png 854w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>\n<p>This makes much less work to maintain the main blockchain and allows for the ability to handle many small transactions within the subnetworks.  As of the start of this year, there is a beta system running live on the Bitcoin test net, but the system will not be ready for a little while yet.</p>\n<p>IOTA is another example of a beta system where existing blockchains are able to handle a high volume of transactions by using parallel operations, with the data structure acting more like a network than a linear chain. With this system structure, the processing and validation can happen right alongside each other.</p>\n<p>The difference with this system is that there are no specialized miners in the network because every node that uses this network does the same work.  In this system, every node making a transaction also works to form a consensus. The diffusion of mining activities within these networks is what eliminates those bottlenecks that slow the whole thing down and demands tons of energy.</p>\n<p>Also, with this network, there are no transaction fees for validation, and because this system is user-generated, the more people that use the network the faster it becomes.  This is the complete opposite of existing systems today, making IOTA very scalable.</p>\n<p>These are only two of the ideas being explored today to make the 3rd generation of blockchain technology useable for tomorrow&#8217;s demand.  As you can see, the blockchain is an emerging technology, and, as it expands and evolves, its applications could be endless.  If everything continues to grow as it has since the beginning, <a href="https://cryptoinvestinginsider.com/">investing in blockchain</a> would be a smart decision. The advancement of this technology could, and most probably will evolve into a globally distributed computer system that will change everything.  Just as the light bulb changed the world in 1879, so could blockchain technology if only we continue to find viable solutions that allow it to grow.</p>\n<p><em><strong>About the author:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Chris Douthit<br />\n@chris_douthit</p>\n<p>Chris Douthit is a stock and cryptocurrency analyst who’s worked in both finance and technology for nearly 20 years.

        content: '<span class="entry-content"><p>The co-founder of Apple strongly believes in Bitcoin as being distinct from the rest of the altcoin space. According to Steve Wozniak, of the 1,500 cryptocurrencies in existence, only Bitcoin can be considered &#8216;pure.&#8217;</p>\n<h2>Wozniak Hopes for Bitcoin to Become a Single Global Currency</h2>\n<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-global-currency.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">CNBC</a> on Monday, Wozniak stated that he hopes Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey&#8217;s belief in Bitcoin will come true. The Apple co-founder made the following comments at the Money 2020 conference being held this week in Amsterdam:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it&#8217;s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wozniak was referring to Dorsey&#8217;s comments back in March of this year. The founder and CEO of both Twitter and Square <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/03/21/twitter-ceo-believes-bitcoin-will-emerge-single-currency-whole-world/" data-wpel-link="internal">stated</a> that he felt that a single currency would emerge for the internet and the world. He went on to state that this currency would be Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>According to the article in CNBC today, Wozniak had bought Bitcoin when each was around $700. He&#8217;d since sold all but one. However, even someone as technically capable as the co-founder of Apple was a still able to fall victim to a scam. He was <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/02/27/steve-wozniak-i-had-seven-bitcoins-stolen-from-me-through-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal">defrauded</a> out of a quantity of the digital currency when exchanging them back to dollars. In addition to his single Bitcoin, he also holds two Ether coins &#8211; the native currency on the Ethereum network.</p>\n<p>In the interview today, Wozniak sang the praises of Bitcoin more astutely than many commentators are capable of. He spoke fondly of its qualities of decentralisation and limited supply, likening it to a natural phenomenon that doesn&#8217;t require human intervention to work:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there&#8217;s a way it&#8217;s distributed… and it&#8217;s pure and there&#8217;s no human running, there&#8217;s no company running and it&#8217;s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Finally, Wozniak addressed the altcoin space . He claimed none could ultimately compete with Bitcoin since each must serve the company that created it. Again, the topic of decentralisation was raised in his assessment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That&#8217;s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<pre>Featured image from Shutterstock.</pre>\n</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/04/steve-wozniak-only-bitcoin-is-pure-digital-gold/" data-wpel-link="internal">Steve Wozniak: &#8216;Only Bitcoin is Pure Digital Gold&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com" data-wpel-link="internal">NewsBTC</a>.</p>',

Now, even the United States are catching up. New York state is planning to establish a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-york-state-legislature-proposes-creation-of-cryptocurrency-task-force">task force</a> to study the implications of digital currencies on the financial markets in New York.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">A few countries like Norway and Switzerland are toying with the idea of launching their own digital currency. Estonia had plans to establish a national cryptocurrency, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/estonia-rolls-back-its-plan-to-issue-national-digital-currency">Estcoin</a> but had to shelve its proposal following an objection from the European Central Bank.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">While the launch of a US-based crypto ETF is still a distant dream, Huobi, the third largest crypto exchange in the world by trade volume has launched an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-huobi-jointly-launches-93-mln-china-south-korea-blockchain-fund">ETF</a>, based on its market index. The world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange, Binance, also announced <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-crypto-exchange-binance-seeks-20-major-partners-for-giant-1-bln-fund">plans</a> to launch a $1 billion fund to invest in crypto startups.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">We believe that the globe is moving towards a greater adoption of cryptocurrencies, which should fuel the next leg of the rally. We want to take advantage of the current fall in the crypto markets to establish positions, however, we are waiting for the opportune time to invest. Let&rsquo;s see if we can locate any buy setups today.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">BTC/USD</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> rallied close to the 20-day EMA but could not break out of it. If it doesn&rsquo;t stop at the current levels, it can fall to $7300 and below that it will retest $7100. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="BTC/USD" src="//cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1ebaf3dface11cb899601694a6a6eaab.png" title="BTC/USD" /></p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The 20-day EMA acts as a resistance in a downtrend and acts as a support in an uptrend. Therefore, until the <a  href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=btc" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BTC/USD</a> pair breaks out of the 20-day EMA, it will remain negative and susceptible to selling pressure on any rally.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The traders should wait for a dip below $7,000 or a breakout above the 20-day EMA to establish long positions. We don&rsquo;t find any buy setups at the current levels; hence, we suggest traders to remain on the sidelines.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">ETH/USD</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum</a> is trading inside the descending channel, making lower lows and lower highs. The trend will change when the digital currency breaks this streak and makes a higher high and a higher low.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">From the support line of the channel on May 28, the digital currency rallied to the resistance line of the channel on June 03 but the bulls could not break out of the channel; hence, prices have again turned down today. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="ETH/USD" src="//cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/eecac31307446952c81b76f7ff14c599.png" title="ETH/USD" /></p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">If the next dip doesn&rsquo;t break below the intraday low of May 28, it will be a positive sign. We suggest traders to wait for the <a  href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=eth" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ETH/USD</a> pair to break out and close (UTC time frame) above the descending channel before initiating any long positions.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Conversely, if the digital currency breaks below $492.5, it can again decline to the support line of the channel, close to $464. We didn&rsquo;t find any buy setups at the current levels.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">XRP/USD</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ripple">Ripple</a> bounced off the critical support at $0.56270 and scaled above the 20-day EMA but could not break out of the 50-day SMA. It continues to trade inside a descending triangle, which is a bearish sign. A break below the $0.54 level can extend the fall to $0.45.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="XRP/USD" src="//cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/a7f11befcb7b901fdfdbcd599f50f4d1.png" title="XRP/USD" /></p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The first sign of strength will be when the <a  href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=xrp" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">XRP/USD</a> pair breaks out of the $0.83 levels. Both moving averages are flattening out, which points to a range-bound action, rather than a trending move.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">We shall wait for a couple of days before suggesting any trade on it.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">BCH/USD</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">We were expecting <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-cash">Bitcoin Cash</a> to trade in a small range but we were proven wrong as it rallied for the past two days and came close to the 50-day SMA.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="BCH/USD" src="//cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/c69d9ecb51988598374fa288d0df954a.png" title="BCH/USD" /></p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The <a  href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BCHUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=bch" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BCH/USD</a> pair is turning down from just above $1,200 levels. It can take support at the 20-day EMA or at the $1000 levels.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">If either of the supports hold, the bulls will again attempt to break out of the 50-day SMA and rally to $1,400 levels.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">We shall wait for the virtual currency to find some support before suggesting any trades.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">EOS/USD</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/eos">EOS</a> spiked after its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-price-jumps-on-news-of-eosio-10-release-50-mln-fund-to-support-ecosystem">EOSIO 1.0 launch</a> and came close to its first target objective of $15.6356, specified in our <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-bitcoin-cash-eos-litecoin-cardano-stellar-iota-price-analysis-june-01">previous</a> analysis.

The 20-day EMA is also located just above this level.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">If the level holds, the bulls will try to resume the up move towards $18.67 levels once again but if the support breaks, the digital currency will re-enter the range and can slump back to $10.3384 levels.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">We shall wait for more clarity to emerge before recommending any trade on it.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">LTC/USD</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/litecoin">Litecoin</a> has turned down from the $127 levels, which is a major resistance. Its downside support is at $115.447, which is the intraday low of May 30. If this level breaks, a slide to $107.102 is possible.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">However, if the level holds, the bulls will again attempt to break out of the overhead resistance.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="LTC/USD" src="//cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/203f72a3a74dc47e7395fdc48aa5d0d4.png" title="LTC/USD" /></p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">If the <a  href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=ltc" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LTC/USD</a> pair breaks out of $127, it can rally to the downtrend line of the descending triangle, close to $150. Therefore, we recommend a long position on a close (UTC time frame) above $127 with a close stop loss.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">We recommend to keep the allocation size less than 50 percent of usual for this trade because the digital currency is still trading inside a bearish pattern. The negative setup will be invalidated if the bulls break out of $160.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">ADA/USD</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">For the past two days, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cardano">Cardano</a> broke above the $0.23 levels on an intraday basis but could not close (UTC time frame) above it. Hence, our buy recommendation <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-bitcoin-cash-eos-litecoin-cardano-stellar-iota-price-analysis-june-01">suggested</a> in the previous analysis did not trigger.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="ADA/USD" src="//cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/259c65e18cf3b0cb0f3a9edbde00e3a7.png" title="ADA/USD" /></p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Currently, the <a  href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSDT/" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ADA/USD</a> pair has turned down.

Now, even the United States are catching up. New York state is planning to establish a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-york-state-legislature-proposes-creation-of-cryptocurrency-task-force">task force</a> to study the implications of digital currencies on the financial markets in New York.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">A few countries like Norway and Switzerland are toying with the idea of launching their own digital currency. Estonia had plans to establish a national cryptocurrency, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/estonia-rolls-back-its-plan-to-issue-national-digital-currency">Estcoin</a> but had to shelve its proposal following an objection from the European Central Bank.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">While the launch of a US-based crypto ETF is still a distant dream, Huobi, the third largest crypto exchange in the world by trade volume has launched an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-huobi-jointly-launches-93-mln-china-south-korea-blockchain-fund">ETF</a>, based on its market index. The world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange, Binance, also announced <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-crypto-exchange-binance-seeks-20-major-partners-for-giant-1-bln-fund">plans</a> to launch a $1 billion fund to invest in crypto startups.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We believe that the globe is moving towards a greater adoption of cryptocurrencies, which should fuel the next leg of the rally. We want to take advantage of the current fall in the crypto markets to establish positions, however, we are waiting for the opportune time to invest. Let&rsquo;s see if we can locate any buy setups today.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">BTC/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> rallied close to the 20-day EMA but could not break out of it. If it doesn&rsquo;t stop at the current levels, it can fall to $7300 and below that it will retest $7100. &nbsp;</p>\n<p dir="ltr">\n<p dir="ltr">The 20-day EMA acts as a resistance in a downtrend and acts as a support in an uptrend. Therefore, until the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=btc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BTC/USD</a> pair breaks out of the 20-day EMA, it will remain negative and susceptible to selling pressure on any rally.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The traders should wait for a dip below $7,000 or a breakout above the 20-day EMA to establish long positions. We don&rsquo;t find any buy setups at the current levels; hence, we suggest traders to remain on the sidelines.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">ETH/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum</a> is trading inside the descending channel, making lower lows and lower highs. The trend will change when the digital currency breaks this streak and makes a higher high and a higher low.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">From the support line of the channel on May 28, the digital currency rallied to the resistance line of the channel on June 03 but the bulls could not break out of the channel; hence, prices have again turned down today. &nbsp;</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="ETH/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/eecac31307446952c81b76f7ff14c599.png" title="ETH/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">If the next dip doesn&rsquo;t break below the intraday low of May 28, it will be a positive sign. We suggest traders to wait for the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=eth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ETH/USD</a> pair to break out and close (UTC time frame) above the descending channel before initiating any long positions.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Conversely, if the digital currency breaks below $492.5, it can again decline to the support line of the channel, close to $464. We didn&rsquo;t find any buy setups at the current levels.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">XRP/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ripple">Ripple</a> bounced off the critical support at $0.56270 and scaled above the 20-day EMA but could not break out of the 50-day SMA. It continues to trade inside a descending triangle, which is a bearish sign. A break below the $0.54 level can extend the fall to $0.45.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="XRP/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/a7f11befcb7b901fdfdbcd599f50f4d1.png" title="XRP/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">The first sign of strength will be when the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=xrp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">XRP/USD</a> pair breaks out of the $0.83 levels. Both moving averages are flattening out, which points to a range-bound action, rather than a trending move.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We shall wait for a couple of days before suggesting any trade on it.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">BCH/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr">We were expecting <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-cash">Bitcoin Cash</a> to trade in a small range but we were proven wrong as it rallied for the past two days and came close to the 50-day SMA.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="BCH/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/c69d9ecb51988598374fa288d0df954a.png" title="BCH/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BCHUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=bch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BCH/USD</a> pair is turning down from just above $1,200 levels. It can take support at the 20-day EMA or at the $1000 levels.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">If either of the supports hold, the bulls will again attempt to break out of the 50-day SMA and rally to $1,400 levels.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We shall wait for the virtual currency to find some support before suggesting any trades.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">EOS/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/eos">EOS</a> spiked after its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-price-jumps-on-news-of-eosio-10-release-50-mln-fund-to-support-ecosystem">EOSIO 1.0 launch</a> and came close to its first target objective of $15.6356, specified in our <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-bitcoin-cash-eos-litecoin-cardano-stellar-iota-price-analysis-june-01">previous</a> analysis. However, we have not recommended any positions because we don&rsquo;t trade during major events due to the high level of uncertainty.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="EOS/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/63b421ef9e66425c2ee7b7fe405366f2.png" title="EOS/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EOSUSD/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EOS/USD</a> pair is witnessing profit taking at higher levels and is likely to retest the breakout levels at $12.9870. The 20-day EMA is also located just above this level.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">If the level holds, the bulls will try to resume the up move towards $18.67 levels once again but if the support breaks, the digital currency will re-enter the range and can slump back to $10.3384 levels.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We shall wait for more clarity to emerge before recommending any trade on it.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">LTC/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/litecoin">Litecoin</a> has turned down from the $127 levels, which is a major resistance. Its downside support is at $115.447, which is the intraday low of May 30. If this level breaks, a slide to $107.102 is possible.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">However, if the level holds, the bulls will again attempt to break out of the overhead resistance.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="LTC/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/203f72a3a74dc47e7395fdc48aa5d0d4.png" title="LTC/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">If the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=ltc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LTC/USD</a> pair breaks out of $127, it can rally to the downtrend line of the descending triangle, close to $150. Therefore, we recommend a long position on a close (UTC time frame) above $127 with a close stop loss.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">We recommend to keep the allocation size less than 50 percent of usual for this trade because the digital currency is still trading inside a bearish pattern. The negative setup will be invalidated if the bulls break out of $160.</p>\n<h2 dir="ltr">ADA/USD</h2>\n<p dir="ltr">For the past two days, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cardano">Cardano</a> broke above the $0.23 levels on an intraday basis but could not close (UTC time frame) above it. Hence, our buy recommendation <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-bitcoin-cash-eos-litecoin-cardano-stellar-iota-price-analysis-june-01">suggested</a> in the previous analysis did not trigger.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="ADA/USD" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/259c65e18cf3b0cb0f3a9edbde00e3a7.png" title="ADA/USD" /></p>\n<p dir="ltr">Currently, the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSDT/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ADA/USD</a> pair has turned down. It has a strong support at the $0.17 levels. If this level breaks, a slide to the bottom of the large range at $0.13 is possible.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, if the bulls stem the current weakness and cause a turnaround, a break out of the $0.23 levels should be positive.

And as cryptocurrency users looking to invest in a new cryptocurrency, we often get to the point where we are not sure when we should invest and what&rsquo;s the best option to put our money in the market.</p>\n<p>Following Ethereum&rsquo;s success as a blockchain platform for growing DApps, decentralized applications, the blockchain space ever so often experiences the emergence of some similar platforms with <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-coinbase-listing-could-happen-soon-five-reasons-why/">EOS</a> being one of them. The Hong Kong-based blockchain, EOS, has been billed as the Ethereum killer. It promises a decentralized application platform (DApp).</p>\n<h3>EOS 101</h3>\n<p>Created by Block.one and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Larimer">Dan Larimer</a>, EOS makes it possible for DApps to scale both vertically and horizontally, and like Ethereum, EOS is a platform that allows other digital coins to come into fruition.</p>\n<p>Its main objective is to answer the problems of speed, scalability, and user experience by providing account recovery, doing away with transaction fees, and alike. The blockchain manages to attain this by using Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.</p>\n<p>Here I will highlight the reasons why EOS is a good investment opportunity.</p>\n<h3>EOS Scalability</h3>\n<p>Blockchain scalability is a real problem especially now when virtual currencies like Bitcoin and <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-tron-erc20-migration-affect-on-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> are competing with more mainstream platforms like MasterCard, <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/paypal-nasdaqpypl-and-verge-xvg-to-partner-soon/">PayPal</a>, and Visa; they seriously need to intensify their performance when it comes to transaction time.</p>\n<p>Although not being a &lsquo;silver bullet&rsquo; to the scalability issue, EOS is built specifically to prioritize scalability performance by ensuring massive adoption of the cryptocurrency is not a problem.</p>\n<p>The EOS platform was built to hold millions of users at the same time making use of its blockchain, but even so, scaling is a continuous problem that has a terrible way of going around any attempts of solving it. As soon as developers improve scalability, products adapt until scalability levels are reached again leading to another performance crisis.</p>\n<h3>Ethereum&rsquo;s (EOS biggest competitor) Current State</h3>\n<p>On several occasions, EOS has been compared to Ethereum with both currencies sharing a similar vision of becoming a decentralized space for trading with cryptocurrencies. However, Ethereum seems to be back peddling away from this vision as it requires a lot of time, work, and resources to implement.</p>\n<p>In the opposite side of the frame, <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-eos-eos-edge-out-bitcoin-cash-bch-after-its-mainnet-launch/">EOS</a> has continued to pursue this vision making it have scalability, and a better-equipped ecosystem that is leading to the platforms become the primary option users.</p>\n<h3>EOS Source of Funds</h3>\n<p>Many of the virtual currencies if not all result in worrying situations when it comes to the facts that relate to funding activities. But thanks to EOS&rsquo;s efforts and success in creating an inflation system that supports the funding of the blockchain, the digital coin can spare users from transaction cost that could have been used to source for funds.</p>\n<p><a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/when-is-the-best-time-to-buy-digital-coins-eos/">EOS</a> relies on a 5% annual inflation that is used to pay block producers and for requests of the whole community.</p>\n<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>\n<p>Holding EOS tokens allows you to use its shared network resources. Meaning you will have access to bandwidth, storage, and many other services after investing in <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-eos-litecoin-top-bets-despite-shaky-crypto-market/">EOS</a>. It&rsquo;s like possessing a digital real estate where the number of digital coins you own provides you with the percentage of space that will be at your disposal.</p>\n<p>It is still too early to predict EOS movements in the future and whether it&rsquo;s going to live up to its expectations. But what can be said is the digital coin has a good team, a grand vision to become great, a successful leader who is an expert in the field, and a lot of potentials. With all this in context, it&rsquo;s easy to understand <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-future-looks-bright-why/">why EOS</a> is a safe and smart investment option at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The fundraising event sold a total of one billion EOS tokens while raising a staggering sum of $4 billion. </strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">A Concentration of Power</h3>\n<p>Nearly 50 percent (49.67 percent) of all EOS tokens are currently distributed among just 10 wallets, according to <a href="https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/06/03/just-10-addresses-hold-nearly-50-eos-tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> from <em>Trustnodes</em>.</p>\n<p>Block.one, the company behind the EOS project, holds 100 million of the entire amount. At the time of this writing, EOS <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is trading</a> at $14.42, giving Block.one another $1.44 billion on top of the $4 billion they managed to raise during the ICO.</p>\n<p>While it’s hard to identify the owners of the remaining top nine addresses, their volumes are entirely public. <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x100634b885f54286762578042a1bfcbeacb91729" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One of the addresses</a> holds 75 million tokens, which roughly translates to around $1 billion. The amount of tokens held by the other top 10 addresses varies, with one of them holding <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x32f1cc71df090341140895e755ed8b35dc0b33b7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20.6 million</a>.

As outlined by <em>Trustnodes</em>, it’s highly likely that most of the addresses belong to popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bitfinex, Binance, Upbit, Huobi, Bithumb, and OKEx.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71895" src="http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chess-pix.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="423" srcset="http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chess-pix.jpg 640w, http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chess-pix-300x198.jpg 300w, http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chess-pix-500x330.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>\n<p>The top 100 addresses account for a total of 748,176,831 tokens, which represents 74.82 percent of the total supply. This means that the next 90 addresses outside of the top 10 hold roughly 250 million tokens — or 25 percent of the total lot.</p>\n<p>The top 1,000 addresses hold 858,120,383 (or 85.81 percent) of all tokens, leaving the 900 addresses between 100 and 1,000 with no more than 11 percent of the entire amount.</p>\n<p>The total amount of token holders is 162,930, meaning that those between #1001 and #162,930 account for a little less than 14 percent. Of course, it’s worth pointing out that individuals or entities can hold more than just one address, so that particular number doesn’t necessarily reflect the number of holders. Conversely, individuals may not be involved in the blockchain and participate in <a href="http://bitcoinist.com/eos-heres-know-investing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOS</a> token trading only through exchanges, so the number of address holders can be widely underestimated.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, one thing is certain — almost 50 percent of the total amount of EOS tokens is concentrated within 10 (or potentially less) individuals or entities.</p>\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">Why is This Important?</h3>\n<p>Instead of being run by a limited number of mining pools, <a href="http://bitcoinist.com/eos-moved-115-million-worth-eth-bitfinex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOS</a> is intended to have a group of 21 Block Producers (BP) voted in by the community. Under the Delegated Proof-of-Stake algorithm the network is running, block producers will be creating the blocks of the blockchain and receiving substantial rewards in EOS tokens which are produced by token inflation.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-71558" src="http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_773287933-eos-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="344" srcset="http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_773287933-eos-1024x640.jpg 1024w, http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_773287933-eos-300x188.jpg 300w, http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_773287933-eos-768x480.jpg 768w, http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_773287933-eos-1120x700.jpg 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>\n<p>BPs are supposed to be chosen in democratic elections where each EOS token can be used to vote for up to 30 different BP candidates. Technically, anyone who has obtained EOS tokens can register to become a block producer and be voted in by the community.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned breakdown of the token distribution brings up an alarming concern – 10 addresses, supposedly held by 10 individuals or entities (or even less), hold almost 50 percent of the voting power. According to the <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/eos-block-producer-voting-guide-fba3a5a6efe0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official post</a> describing the mechanics of the BP elections, the quorum needed for the elections to be valid is 15 percent.</p>\n<p>In other words, those 10 addresses have the full potential to seriously impact and even determine the outcome of any potential elections at any given moment — as they’d always constitute a valid quorum.</p>\n<p>Thus, the state of the entire EOS blockchain is likely to be determined by a mere 1,000 address holders, as they account for 85 percent of the total amount of EOS tokens. Given that there are more than 160,000 contributors to the project, arguments can be made regarding the level of democracy supposedly governing the project.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What do you think about EOS concentration of power?

He mentioned to <em>ABC</em> that he won local business’ support to bring the emerging technology to the Queensland town.</p>\n<p><em>ABC</em> reported on June 3, cryptocurrency groups and tourists from <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/?s=japan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japan</a> will visit the Queensland town to aid them with their new cryptocurrency launch campaign.</p>\n<h2>Australian Town Leverages Cryptocurrency Movement to Boost Tourism</h2>\n<p>Christian initially explored digital currencies when his client asked him about processing <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/news/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin</a> payments from customers. When he realized that the Brisbane airport was accepting digital currency payments, he “thought, this is something worth having a look at.”</p>\n<p>The local real estate agent managed to gain the support of over 2,000 permanent residents to explore cryptocurrencies. “We started from the ground up, shared it with a couple of businesses, and they were straight on board… I guess they were international travelers themselves and had heard of these types of payments,” said Christian. “Initially, we had a good ten businesses that just said, &#8216;Fine let’s go for it.&#8217;”</p>\n<p>The idea to attract the “<a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-travel-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital traveler</a>” quickly took off within the community. “So it started out as, well how would they get here? Could we provide a shuttle service to bring them from the airport or the railway station? Then [we considered], Where would they stay and what are they going to do when they get here?”</p>\n<p>Christian added that 31 businesses from the Queensland town have signed up. These companies range from backpackers to resorts, tour companies, the local pub, restaurants, and even day spas.</p>\n<h3>TravelbyBit Helps Companies Looking to Utilize Cryptocurrency</h3>\n<p>Over time, there have been more brick and mortar retailers across Australia looking to accept digital currencies as a form of payment.</p>\n<p>Queensland startup TravelbyBit is aiding this new financial frontier by launching a point-of-sale application that helps businesses accept cryptocurrency payments. Just last week, the startup rolled out its cryptocurrency payment system at <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/brisbane-airport-start-accepting-bitcoin-payments-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brisbane airport</a>, making Brisbane “Australia’s first digital currency-friendly airport.”</p>\n<p>“If you travel around the world you have to deal with multiple currencies, the exchange rate can be confusing, sometimes you struggle to find ATMs, and sometimes you get swindled by money changers,” said Caleb Yeoh, TravelbyBit’s CEO. “Travelling with one global currency like bitcoin&#8230;makes sense. <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/news/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blockchain</a> has the ability to make transactions a lot more transparent and efficient&#8230;I think it’s the way of the future.”</p>\n<p>Yeoh added that “the town has made a very strategic move trying to appeal to a niche market to take perhaps some of those tourists…to come out to their little part of the woods. People who use <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/cryptocyclopedia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a>&#8230;it’s a social movement, and they believe in it, and therefore they support places&#8230;who take it. So they would come to a place like this just because it takes digital currency.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com/the-australian-beach-town-where-you-can-pay-for-your-holiday-in-bitcoin/">The Australian Beach Town Where You Can Pay for Your Holiday in Bitcoin</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com">BTCMANAGER</a>.</p>',

According to the platform, Q is going to be &ldquo;the most significant contribution to the IOTA stack&rdquo;. Simply put, it&rsquo;s a new era in which a limitless number of use cases could be applied. And Hodling just became such a familiar word.</p>\n<p>The IOTA just unleashed a weapon against those accusations that it wouldn&rsquo;t work for lack of nodes. What the new project will do is to combine a whole host of blockchain mechanisms into one protocol. Now there&rsquo;s Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, Proof of Bandwidth, and Proof of Honesty, all in the Q network.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentivize the community</strong></p>\n<p>According to the Qubic team, the protocol offers great incentives for anyone who wishes to run a node. One can let others use their spare computational power for a fee or rent out that extra storage capacity and earn rewards in the form of MIOTA. It, therefore, provides everyone with a chance to offer some service and get paid for the same.</p>\n<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you use Asics, GPUs or CPUs. For example, Q-nodes can be used to &ldquo;give new life to old, abandoned PCs&rdquo;. These seemingly useless PCs could be put to work, offering a great incentive to miners.</p>\n<p>And what it leads to is a massive network where a whole community could earn rewards using the oracles system, the smart contracts or from other users who buy computational resources.</p>\n<p><strong>New era begins</strong></p>\n<p>It is expected the project will take two years of further development before finally being deployed on the Tangle. The excitement with the Iota community is understandably palpable. According to Alexander Renz on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/iota-qubic-start-new-era-fulfillment-long-time-dream-alexander-renz/?published=t">LinkedIn</a>,</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Qubic introduces not only oracles and smart contracts, but quorum-based computations, a form of distributed computing. It essentially makes the IOTA Tangle programmable and leverages the data transfer protocol and peer-to-peer fee-less micro transactions to create incentives for outsourced computations using zero-fee micro-transactions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a possibility no other platform could achieve IoT and M2M as it is envisioned by the IOTA Foundation via the Qubic project. Alexander believes it&rsquo;ll completely change the game.</p>\n<p>He goes on to say that &ldquo;In the future, Qubic will leverage the worldwide available, unused computation capacity to solve all kinds of computational problems.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Messaging and payment app</strong></p>\n<p>Qubic began in 2012 as an idea to have a Quorum-based coin. However, that changed over time, evolving into the current form that sees it become a &ldquo;working protocol to serve as the messaging and payment system: IOTA.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Qubic follows in the footsteps of the original idea behind IOTA- to enable communication and payments in an IoT ecosystem. Indeed, the project&rsquo;s team acknowledges that it&rsquo;s been made possible as a result of the fee-free transactions on the IOTA network.</p>\n<p>Qubic works as a powerful distributed fog-computing platform. It&rsquo;s useful in the creation of complex IoT applications, and a new generation type of smart contracts. Furthermore, the network is designed to automatically collect micro-payments as it works and in real time.</p>\n<p><strong>IOTA (MIOTA) and the market</strong></p>\n<p>The excitement over the release of the Qubic project was a perfect event for the coin. It should, under normal circumstances, have helped push MIOTA prices a little higher. However, that hasn&rsquo;t happened and the coin&rsquo;s prices tanked further today.</p>\n<p>Like many other cryptocurrencies, IOTA had a very good end to the month of May. On May 29th, the coin traded at $136 against the US dollar. It rose within the three days to hit a new high of $2.00 on June 3, 2018. It later leveled off and closed the day at $181.</p>\n<p>Today it&rsquo;s trading at $1.71 (at the time of writing), has seen its value decline by 5.94% in the last 24 hours. That is the case over 24 hours, but in the last 7 days, the coin has seen a price growth of +20%.</p>\n<p>The token remains in 9th position with a market cap of $4.75 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $116 million.</p>\n<p>Even though the market hasn&rsquo;t responded to the event as though, one thing is not in doubt: the future of IOTA (MIOTA) appears better. What does that mean? HODL.</p>\n</p>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://stocksgazette.com/2018/06/04/iota-miotas-qubic-project-will-make-you-a-proud-hodler-new-era-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IOTA (MIOTA)&rsquo;s Qubic Project will make you a proud HODLer &ndash; New Era is Here</a> was originally published on <a href="https://stocksgazette.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://stocksgazette.com/</a>.

A trusted system requires checks and balances to ensure that the trust we place in it remains secure, while a trustless system does&nbsp;not.</p>\n<p>A good example of a trusted system is modern fiat currency. The money we hold in our bank accounts and wallets is backed only by the promise of the government printing it. It&rsquo;s up to the government to ensure that the currency stays stable and that goods and services can reliably be exchanged for it. The government is the intermediary guaranteeing the value of the currency and has to be trusted for any exchange to take&nbsp;place.</p>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*zSIqKndLLyPOwyq3eoE1KA.png" alt="Image result for trustless" /><figcaption>Trust is no longer mandatory</figcaption></figure>\n<p>DLT removes the need for intermediaries by anchoring the trustability of the system on the algorithms that it is composed of. It is mathematically incapable of duplicity and requires no mediation. By providing a trustless system without intermediaries, DLT opens up possibilities for people to interact in ways that has never existed before. This behavioral change will initiate the end for many industries that have long dominated society and signal the beginning for new ones based on a decentralized future.</p>\n<h3>IOTA is disrupting the DLT&nbsp;Space</h3>\n<p>IOTA is a DLT built specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. The team behind IOTA realized that in the IoT machine-economy of the future, millions of computers and sensors would need to interact and pay each other, often in micro and nano-payments. They also realized that blockchain networks wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle such transactions because of ever increasing transaction fees and scalability limits. Moreover, the energy-intensive mining and consensus mechanisms of traditional blockchains would not be a good fit with low cost IoT devices and intermittent networks.</p>\n<p>This meant that if the Internet of Things and DLT were ever going to merge, a new kind of &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; would need to be developed, which is exactly what the IOTA team created &ndash; the Tangle network. To be precise, the IOTA Tangle is not a blockchain. Instead it uses a data structure called Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and in doing so, the Tangle doesn&rsquo;t just maintain the original benefits of blockchain, it can improve on them exponentially.</p>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/624/0*6MoapD1SDBbxcLcJ.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Solving the blockchain&rsquo;s bottleneck</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The core innovation behind using a DAG is its ability to conduct zero-fee transactions and therefore, the ability to conduct nano-payments. This is achieved by cutting out miners and miner fees, which the Tangle in particular does by making validation of transactions an intrinsic part of the ledger&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;making miners (people validating transactions) and stakers (people sending transactions) one and the&nbsp;same.</p>\n<h3>Qubic: the missing&nbsp;puzzle</h3>\n<p>IOTA presented a novel DLT implementation: a blockchainless approach built specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT) and the machine-to-machine (M2M) economy. IOTA has the potential to bring virtually unlimited scalability and fee-less nano-transactions to the world. However, important features such as smart contracts were&nbsp;missing.</p>\n<p>Last week, the IOTA Foundation has brought an end to months of speculation surrounding <a href="https://twitter.com/iotatoken/status/1003305957932269568">the Qubic project</a>. Being touted as the most eagerly awaited development in the history of IOTA, the new project seeks to create a protocol that <em>&ldquo;specifies IOTA&rsquo;s solution for oracle machines, smart contracts, outsourced computations, and&nbsp;more.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Qubic introduces not only oracles and smart contracts, but quorum-based computations, a form of distributed computing. In short, Qubic makes the IOTA Tangle programmable and introduces a distributed computing environment where machines can establish trust, share data and pay each other for any resources using fee-less nano-transactions.</p>\n<h4>Oracles</h4>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*J2-6VrriC3E8nEmV.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Quorum consensus of an oracle&nbsp;assembly</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A DLT like the Tangle cannot access data outside its network. Oracles are third party services that find and verify real-world data and feed this data to a DLT to be used for computations (e.g. smart contracts&hellip;). Such data could be any data like weather temperature, successful payment, price fluctuations, etc.</p>\n<p>The incentive for oracles to stay honest is a reward system maintained by the qubic owners. Note that Qubic does not na&iuml;vely &ldquo;trust&rdquo; the third-party oracles. It ensures a high degree of certainty about the correctness of the data in question via a quorum consensus.</p>\n<h4>Smart Contracts</h4>\n<p>A smart contract is a computer protocol designed to emulate, and improve upon, the performance of a real-world contract. Its function is to define conditions which when met, execute a contract by the computers in a given network. Smart contracts are considered an innovative way of enhancing operational efficiencies and cutting costs for businesses, merchants and artisans&nbsp;alike.</p>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*kIi86ENePAgKfgwP.png" alt="" /><figcaption>A self-executing, trustless contract</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Smart contracts can automate many different kinds of processes and operations, such as payment and actions conditional on payment, giving rise to previously unimaginable levels of efficiency and precision. They are transforming how deals and transactions are executed and managed in business life-cycles. Some of the potential use cases for smart contracts include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital Identity and Financial Data Recording;</li>\n<li>Trade Finance, Derivatives and Securities;</li>\n<li>Mortgages and Land Title Recording;</li>\n<li>Supply Chain;</li>\n<li>Auto Insurance;</li>\n<li>Clinical Trials</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using IOTA as the backbone, Qubic&rsquo;s smart contracts go beyond these kinds of traditional smart contracts. The combination of fee-free transactions together with general-purpose quorum-based computation opens the door to entirely new possibilities. For example, a smart contract could be used to aggregate temperature data from different oracles into an average temperature, which gets published to the Tangle periodically. The smart contract has now become an oracle in and of itself&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;that is, the contract itself has become a source of external data, available for an oracle machine to pick up and send back to some other&nbsp;qubic.</p>\n<p>These types of smart contracts are also just iterations on the more general capacity for quorum-based computations. Qubic therefore also provides a standardized way to define, validate, and enforce the results of a smart contract to a high degree of certainty.</p>\n<h4>Implications of the Qubic&nbsp;project</h4>\n<p>Qubic leverages the IOTA protocol for secure, decentralized communication between the various participants. Additionally, since IOTA has its own built-in payment system, IOTA tokens are used to provide an incentive system for qubic operators. Anyone can decide for themselves at what threshold a reward becomes interesting enough to participate.</p>\n<p>Qubic offers a great incentive for people to run nodes: let others use spare computational power or storage capacity, thus providing a useful service, and get paid to do so. Q-nodes can give new life to old, abandoned PCs, and they can provide traditional cryptocurrency miners with a way of monetizing equipment by doing useful computations instead of solving meaningless (and wasteful) cryptographic puzzles.</p>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*2t41M6BGPX7ASqhd.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Leveraging otherwise-wasteful resources</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Qubic is optimized for the IoT &ndash; low energy consumption and a small memory footprint &ndash; but that does not preclude large-scale computations, especially for computations that may be parallelized and distributed over a large number of processors. In the future, Qubic will leverage the world-wide available, unused computation capacity to solve all kinds of computational problems, all while helping to secure the Tangle: an IOTA-based world supercomputer.</p>\n<h3>The Machine&nbsp;Economy</h3>\n<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*ap8JJWpuuhayvo9s" alt="" /><figcaption>The Machine Economy&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Powered by&nbsp;IOTA</figcaption></figure>\n<p>With Qubic, IOTA Tangle will overcome the limitations of blockchain, to offer a complete technology stack of financial management, distributed computing, distributed artificial intelligence and swarm intelligence, leveraging trustable and immutable data stored in the Tangle as well as gathered from the real world. Let&rsquo;s imagine an economy where: everything will be smart, efficient, autonomous and connected, economically independent and most likely managed by a secure, decentralized technical backbone &ndash;&nbsp;IOTA.</p>\n<p>In the near future, as a consequence, we can expect that a machine will be able to pay its assembly, its maintenance, its energy and also for its liability insurance by giving data, computing power, storage or physical services to other machines. For the first time in history a device will be in a position to earn and spend money on its own. Such is a Machine Economy made possible by&nbsp;Qubic.</p>\n<p>(For more information regarding Qubic, visit: <a href="https://qubic.iota.org/">https://qubic.iota.org/</a>)</p>\n<p><em>IOTA Donations would be much appreciated:</em></p>\n<pre>OEZSSIQJ9IWGHNODFAOQXGYZRBBEQAYTRDFCNWAZSPZILWQO9VYOYSXMQEDGYIURFAWQIIEHZQABDTTAAXFTANN9HD</pre>\n<p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=43da90464797" width="1" height="1" /></p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-iotas-qubic-is-enabling-the-machine-economy-43da90464797">How IOTA&rsquo;s Qubic is Enabling the Machine Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n</p>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-iotas-qubic-is-enabling-the-machine-economy-43da90464797?source=rss-c5b78e27b6c8------2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">How IOTA&rsquo;s Qubic is Enabling the Machine Economy</a> was originally published on <a href="https://medium.com/@Zass27?source=rss-c5b78e27b6c8------2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://medium.com/@Zass27?source=rss-c5b78e27b6c8&#8212;&#8212;2</a>.

The explanations still hold true as the details of Qubic seem to work as I assumed. However, a lot more information has come to light about the implementation details of Qubic. The concepts are very hard to understand, but in this blog, I will try and explain it in an easy to follow way.</p>\n<p><strong>Qubic explained<br /></strong>So far, IOTA is used as a platform for feeless transactions with great scalability. With the introduction of the IOTA Data marketplace, Internet of Things (IoT) devices could start sending data to the Tangle. The data could be purchased by other individuals or devices for applications like machine learning. However, that would all be done outside of the IOTA environment. With the new Qubic release, IOTA can serve as a platform for data gathering, processing and even allow systems to respond to the results, without the need for any servers or third parties. The IOTA Tangle was developed to become a platform for Qubic, which means that Qubic is the big second step in the vision of the IOTA Foundation for IOTA. The new Qubic protocols require a distributed ledger with zero fee transactions and data transfer capabilities, which is what IOTA is today.</p>\n<p>Currently, IoT devices can upload data to the Tangle in data streams. In addition to IoT sensor data, the data on the Tangle could come from external sources like a news feed or even human input like lab observations or bird spotting. All sources of external information are called Oracles. Some Oracles might already compress data from a set of other Oracles, enriching the data and creating a new source of information for applications. The problem with basing decisions on external data sources is the fact that these Oracles have power over your decision making. Therefore, we need to either only use Oracles we trust, or acquire data from multiple Oracles and try to find out what the true data is.</p>\n<p>Finding such a consensus among the Oracles can be done through a smart contract, which is called a Qubic. A Qubic is a piece of code that receives input data and outputs a conclusion. However, the calculation is executed on a set of machines to achieve a truly trustless application. Oracles that execute the Qubic code are called Oracle Machines. The entire set of Oracles that execute the Qubic is called an Assembly. &nbsp;Once 66% of the Assembly comes to the same conclusion, the Quorum (minimum number of agreeing Oracles to reach consensus) is reached and the result of the Qubic is outputted to the Tangle. The result of one Qubic can possibly be fed into another Qubic, triggering the execution of the second Qubic. This allows the creation of a cascade of Qubic function calls that together can resolve complex tasks. Anyone can add to the cascade of Qubics and therefore the Qubics don&rsquo;t require a single owner. For example, a transportation company may have set up a traffic prediction Qubic using a cascade of Qubics to process traffic Oracles. Another party might want to further process the traffic predictions to calculate the best time to do road constructions. They do this by automatically executing their Qubic based on new information received from the traffic prediction Qubic.</p>\n<p>The code for all these Qubics will be written in a completely new programming language called Abra, developed by the IOTA Foundation. Abra is a functional programming language that avoids global states. Given a constant input, every device will output the same values. This is a lot easier to debug and platform agnostic, hopefully preventing costly smart contract issues that have happened before. Abra is made to work optimally with trinary computers. Our next IOTA Deepdive blog will explain why this is important.</p>\n<p><strong>Protection against dishonest Oracles<br /></strong>A Qubic smart contract will only be executed in the Assembly, where other smart contract platforms will execute the code on every node on the network. This is great for scalability and reduces the costs for the creator of the smart contract. However, this does reduce the security as smart contracts use the concept of trust in numbers (more executing nodes = less chance of cheating). Fortunately, the Qubic protocol has several mechanisms to decrease the chances of dishonest or cheating participants who reach a Quorum with incorrect or copied results.</p>\n<p>In my previous blog, I hypothesized that Qubics might be free, due to the nature of feeless transactions on the Tangle. It turns out that execution of Qubics does cost money. Every Oracle that has helped reach Quorum using the accepted truth is paid for participation, while Oracles who were &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; and outputted the wrong result do not get paid. The total costs of executing the Qubic depends on what the creator is willing to offer, and the Assembly can decide if they find the payment sufficient. This is a basic supply and demand model that is also found in blockchain fees. The Oracles collect this fee, which allows anyone with spare hardware to run an Oracle and receive money in exchange for there computational power. In essence, this is like mining, but while actually doing a useful task!</p>\n<p>The creator of the Qubic can choose which Assembly they want to run their Qubic on. The decision will be based on the size and reputation of the Assembly. A bigger Assembly will have more individual Oracles, which decreases the chance of a cheated Quorum result. However, having more participants also requires you to pay more Oracles, thus increase the expenses. The payment of honest Oracles is a great incentive to both run an Oracle and keep it honest. In addition, the Oracle might not be in the same Assembly all the time. An Assembly can change in size based on a vote between Assembly members and this might even give an Assembly the ability to kick out dishonest participants or increase in size to reduce the effect of the known dishonest participants.</p>\n<p>To prevent malicious actors to split their hardware into multiple Oracles within the same Assembly to create more voting power, the Qubic protocol has a resource test. Depending on the Assembly, the resource test will benchmark the hardware of the Oracle by requesting a stress test. For example, to measure computational power, an Oracle must complete as many Proof-of-Work puzzles in a set timeframe. If a malicious actor would run two Oracles on the same hardware, the performance would half for each Oracle. The performance of the Oracles determines the size of their vote to reach a Quorum. Thus, making it irrelevant if a malicious actor has multiple Oracles on the same hardware. Lastly, the system prevents Oracles from copying the results from other Oracles, using a commit and reveal design. All Oracles submit their findings first in the form of a hash of the result and a hash of the result concatenated with a unique random number. This makes copying the results impossible and forces the Oracles to come up with there own answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Business implications<br /></strong>Although the Qubic project has now unveiled its details, we are still far away from a working implementation. The project is the top priority for the fast-growing IOTA Foundation, meaning we will see regular updates. What we do know is that it is going to have a big impact on many industries. Any company which is interested in trustless applications should have a look into IOTA and Qubic. In addition, IOTA and Qubic add a lot of new options for revenue streams. IOTA already allowed businesses to sell their (enriched) data, but with Qubic, companies can set up an Oracle to sell their computational models as well! We could even go a step further and expect the distributed computing to train and improve machine learning models and turn these into profitable Oracles, without the need of high-performance hardware.</p>\n<p>Another technology that might be disrupted is the trend of serverless computation and microservices, which is popular in IoT, as Qubics are very similar. However, Qubics have an inherited feeless payment protocol and are decentralized, therefore removing the influence from the cloud providers. Companies that currently work on any blockchain/DLT use case should reconsider using IOTA for all the advantages. IOTA with Qubic allows free transactions and relatively cheap execution of smart contracts. It is also a fact that IOTA and Qubic both scale and are future proof, allowing companies to prepare for bigger use cases that won&rsquo;t be halted by the limitation of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://vxcompany.com/2018/06/04/iotas-qubic-explained-2/">IOTA&rsquo;s Qubic explained #2<br /></a><span> was originally published on </span><a href="https://vxcompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">vxcompany.com</a><span>.The IOTA-News Community curates, examines, and summarizes news from external services while producing its own original material.

As noted by <em>Finance Magnates</em>, the exchange processes roughly $20 million in cryptocurrency trading per day — with some expecting the cryptocurrency exchange to overtake Indonesia&#8217;s primary stock exchange in terms of users this year.</p>\n<p>The Republic of Indonesia is home to more than 261 million people and thus represents a rather massive market for TRON. However, the use of cryptocurrency is banned in the country — though trading and mining are reportedly still legal.</p>\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">Superior to Ethereum?</h3>\n<p>On May 31, TRON launched its Mainnet during a live stream, which — according to the company — was broadcast to millions of viewers around the world.</p>\n<p>During the live stream, TRON&#8217;s founder, Justin Sun, took the opportunity to boast about his platform&#8217;s supposed advantages over Ethereum. As noted by <a href="https://medium.com/@Tronfoundation/mainnet-launch-livestream-5-31-recap-7e0a8ab15509">an official blog post</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>TRON development worked 12-hour days, 6 days a week to complete the mainnet process in only three months, compared to the 30 months it took Ethereum. Along with finishing the mainnet launch in a much shorter timeline, TRON was able to produce Transactions Per Second (TPS) speeds of 2000 TPS, compared to Ethereums 25 TPS.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is not the first time Sun has boasted of his project&#8217;s supposed superiority over Ethereum. TRON&#8217;s founder once took to Twitter in order to list reasons why his project is better than the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The tweet infamously resulted in Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sarcastically responding with an eighth reason: &#8220;Better white paper writing capability (Ctrl+C + Ctrl+V much higher efficiency than keyboard typing new content).&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">8.

        content: '<div class="optinengine_before_post"></div><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of a smart move by its team, Ripple contribution of around $50 million in the research is deem to attract finances and investors on a really large scale. This might help the cryptocurrency in taking its market value back on track.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The story behind the growing Ripple contributions</b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/the-first-blockchain-etf-in-europe/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain technology</a> is unmasking its real potential and spreading its reaches in market space. Enthusiasts across the globe, are acknowledging its existence and have started taking interest in its working. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University Blockchain Research Initiative or UBRI is one such initiative which accommodates 17 research-oriented universities coming together to fulfill the endeavor that they sought to pursue.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborative partnership with universities from Australia, the US, the Netherlands, Brazil, India, South Korea, the UK, Luxembourg, Cyprus, and Canada will be thus observed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent tweet goes,</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re committing $50M to top, global universities to further #blockchain research, tech and talent for our new University Blockchain Research Initiative!”.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With UBRI, the universities across the globe wish to reformulate their curriculums, in sync with the current foreplay. And consecutively, equip themselves with the latest knowledge base on financial technology and the new concept of crypto world asserting its presence.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Also, read: <a title="22 European Countries Join International Blockchain Partnership" href="https://coingape.com/eu-blockchain-partnership-of-22-countries/?utm_source=read_more&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="bookmark">22 European Countries Join International Blockchain Partnership</a></strong></span></em></p>\n<h3><b>Crypto market seeking collaborations extensively </b></h3>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day in and out, the news of some or the other big crypto being associated with some prestigious linkups is going on air. It seems that the crypto market is also coming in the reaches of the marketing strategies to large extent.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent move of <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-announcement-new-pairs-xrp-usdt/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple </a>funding the UBRI is one amongst many such moves in foreplay of the market setup. Recently we saw many other cryptocurrencies that are joining hands with the number of corporations from different industries. Owing to the statistical approach, everyone is realizing the need for collaborations and the world platforms that they could seek for their representation.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global trends are now that of partnerships and do not even pay heed to isolations anymore. Thus a market that was earlier existing in isolation is slowly and steadily moving towards a “mix-up”.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the current market trends for the crypto accounts for a gloomy <a href="https://coingape.com/ripple-xrp-momentum-xrp-price-to-roof/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decline </a>of 3.7% with the present value at $0.64 USD, it might change to a soaring one soon. As suggested by the analysts in market space, the figures changing to an upward surge is primarily the expectation in prevalence. As drawn from the market trends in foreplay, it has now become more or less an expected move for a currency facing decline, to indulge in associations.</span></p>\n<p><strong>It would now be interesting to see, whether Ripple gets back on its price track with its latest UBRI associations or not? What do you opine in this regard?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class="optinengine_after_post"></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coingape.com/ripple-set-breakthroughs-education-sector/">After Finance, Ripple [XRP] Set to make Breakthroughs in Education Sector</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coingape.com">Coingape</a>.</p>',

The sheer amount of EOS makes it unlikely for the owner make use of a hot wallet.</p>\n<p>In fact, the top ten addresses may not be of a single person/entity, and may even be an interaction between two different exchanges.</p>\n<p>Based on the trading volume data available on CoinMarketCap, cryptocurrency exchanges, OKEx, Bithumb, Upbit, Binance, Bitfinex, Huobi, and Block.one have <a title="" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos/#markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handled over $150 million</a> of EOS transactions in the past 24 hours at press time.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31120" src="https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/EOS-Exchanges.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="323" srcset="https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/EOS-Exchanges.jpg 1366w, https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/EOS-Exchanges-350x197.jpg 350w, https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/EOS-Exchanges-768x432.jpg 768w, https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/EOS-Exchanges-800x450.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">Source: <a title="" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos/#markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>CoinMarketCap</i></a></p>\n<p>Interestingly, as <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/8o7cdw/eos_rich_listgenesis_snapshot_statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a> by Reddit user Lannisan, the top 100 EOS addresses hold 748,176,831 tokens of 74.82 percent of all EOS tokens. Also, the top 1000 accounts hold over 858,120,383 tokens or 85 percent of the total circulating supply.  </p>\n<h2>Not All Can be Exchanges</h2>\n<p>As per CoinMarketCap’s data, only 50 exchanges handled upwards of $1 million EOS in the 24 hours preceding press time, with multiple exchanges repeated to denote the different currency pairs. Hence, at least 75 addresses of the top 100 are not exchanges and hold over $250 million cumulatively.</p>\n<p>Next, an individual/entity would require only 646,595 tokens or $10 million to be part of the exclusive top 100 EOS account club. By all means, this would grant the holder major voting rights.</p>\n<p>According to analytics site Token Analyst, they estimate the percentage of all tokens held by exchanges is <a title="" href="https://www.tokenanalyst.io/token/20/EOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just under 20 percent</a>.</p>\n<h2>Skewed Voting Rights</h2>\n<p>It must be noted that the list does not represent the actual number of EOS holders, as an entity can have more than one address, i.e., the top ten could, in reality, be just five entities.</p>\n<p>Now comes the important part; as per the EOS protocol, shareholder voting is weighted on the number of tokens held. And in this case, ten percent of the total votes can indeed be decisive. With such a high concentration of EOS tokens in the top ten, it becomes almost impossible for these holders to lose if they collude.</p>\n<p>However, with the limitations of the data at hand, it is hard to say for sure whether these addresses are linked to exchanges, as some are vying for Block Producer status &#8211; Block Producers have a chance at being nominated to be one of EOS&#8217;s 21 supernodes. Nevertheless, the distribution fares worse than Ethereum&#8217;s in its early days:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It was nowhere near this bad and ETH didn’t rely on voting to choose block producers who in EOS stand to profit to the tune of of multiple millions per year. <a href="https://t.co/xw7eNQUZ7y">https://t.co/xw7eNQUZ7y</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; panek (@panekkkk) <a href="https://twitter.com/panekkkk/status/1003414928793874432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>For example, Bitfinex, which is holding over $200 million in EOS, after a strike of fortune develops close relations with Block.one. According to <a title="" href="https://www.tokenanalyst.io/token/20/EOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Token Analyst</a>, the exchange holds 17,415,204.89 tokens, less than 50 percent of what Bithumb holds, with Huobi and OKEx also having more considerable holdings. Bitfinex and Block.one (which now hold over 20 percent of voting rights) will cumulatively hold more voting power than the top 1000 account holders.</p>\n<p>One may think that decentralization may come to the rescue of retail investors. However, this is not proving to be the case. Of the four groups that were trying to launch the mainnet, only one chain will be launched, <a title="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/8o5p0g/eos_mainnet_launch_update/e00zxpb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegedly due to</a> EOS Chief Technical Officer Dan Larimer’s influence.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com/eos-snapshot-reveals-10-accounts-hold-almost-50-percent-of-tokens-voting-rights-massively-inequal/">EOS Snapshot Reveals 10 Accounts Hold Almost 50 percent of Tokens: Voting Rights Massively Inequal</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com">BTCMANAGER</a>.</p>',

Two major and highly anticipated MainNet networks were launched in a span of fewer than 3 days. First was the Tron (TRX) MainNet that was launched on the 31st of May. Then EOS (EOS) stole the headlines <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-price-jumps-on-news-of-eosio-10-release-50-mln-fund-to-support-ecosystem">with double-digit gains</a> of the token ahead of the MainNet launch that happened on the 2nd of June. Both projects have been hailed as possible Ethereum Killers and the next generation of smart contract platforms with higher transactions per second and other better features.</p>\n<h5>Will Ethereum (ETH) survive the onslaught of these two MainNets?</h5>\n<p>For now, Ethereum can be considered as being safe from any threats of Tron or EOS Mainnets taking over as the preferred platforms for Decentralized Applications and smart contracts. Ethereum has already created a foundation for dominance.</p>\n<h5>How will Ethereum (ETH) still thrive amongst the competition?</h5>\n<p>To begin with, Ethereum (ETH) is time-tested and has weathered the storm that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/07/a-major-vulnerability-has-frozen-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-of-ethereum/">was security vulnerabilities</a>&nbsp;discovered earlier on in the year as well as the constant FUD with respect to low transactions per second. Yes, the ETH network does get congested due to DApps about animals and kitties, but there is no other stable platform out there that have been tested such as Ethereum. Also to note is the current conversation of <a href="http://bitcoinist.com/vitalik-buterin-sharding-plasma-scale-ethereum-10000-times/">introducing sharding</a> on the ETH network. When this concept materializes, ETH will obliterate any competition.</p>\n<p>EOS on the other hand <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-eos-will-weather-the-storm-of-vulnerabilities-and-come-out-stronger/">recently had</a> a very serious security issue right before the MainNet launch that left many speculating if the MainNet would launch. What was found on the EOS platform, was a vulnerability where a malicious hacker would create and execute a smart contract that would technically hijack the nodes to cause a full-blown cyber attack on other crypto networks. This issue has since been resolved but questions still linger.</p>\n<p>When we analyze the current <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-still-a-fan-favorite-and-a-safe-bet-moving-forward/">Tron</a> project, the foundation has implemented a $10 Million Bug Bounty program to any developer or team of developers that can find any security vulnerabilities before the 24th of June this year. Also to note is the presence of a Tron hackathon in the Tron Project Genesis calendar to further test the Odyssey MainNet for vulnerabilities. This means the MainNet still has a long way to go in terms of gaining trust from DApp developers and showing network stability.</p>\n<p>With respect to market dominance, Ethereum (ETH) is firmly in the number 2 position behind Bitcoin (BTC) and according to market capitalization. As a matter of fact, many Crypto analysts have predicted that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/ethereum-price-latest-updates-bitcoin-cash-roger-ver-crytocurrency-flippening-a8345166.html">ETH will flippen Bitcoin</a> before the end of the year. This means that even crypto-traders still find favor with ETH when it comes to the crypto-markets.</p>\n<p>In summary, both TRON and EOS MainNet platforms are a welcome addition to the crypto-verse platform arena. However, they have a long way to go for them to be considered as potential Ethereum Killers with respect to being platforms of choice and general popularity. ETH is also eons ahead when you consider its market presence with respect to both TRX and EOS.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

What has resulted in the partnership is the formation of SBI Ripple Asia that has spearheaded the adoption of Ripple technologies in the region as well as innovation in the industry of fintech. So far, Ripple has access to over 61 banks in the consortium that makes up SBI Holdings.</p>\n<p>It is, therefore, no surprise that the SBI Group wants to release a cryptocurrency exchange that plans to utilize XRP as the centerpiece for trading on the platform. The exchange, known as SBI Virtual Currencies, has updated <a href="https://www.sbivc.co.jp/">its website</a> and is now live for trading for users who had pre-registered back in October 2017. One thing to note is that XRP is the only cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.sbivc.co.jp/support/cryptocurrency/">on the site</a> that has been described in terms of what it is and its capabilities. The exchange will alter add Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as the second traded digital asset on the platform.</p>\n<p>This means that the CEO and President of SBI Holdings, Yoshitaka Kitao, was serious when he said that once the exchange is ready, it will feature primarily XRP and the exchange will eventually <a href="https://www.businessinsider.jp/post-166536">be number one</a>. The exchange had been scheduled for launch this summer and the XRP HODLers and the entire crypto-verse is applauding and excited with the launch today, June 4th.</p>\n<p>One thing to remember is that the country of Japan is home to over <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/04/10/cryptocurrency-trade-statistics-japan/">3.5 Million</a> crypto traders and HODLers. These traders are between the ages of 20 and 40. This will be the target demographic of the new crypto exchange by the SBI Holdings Group.</p>\n<p>With respect to the cryptocurrency markets, they are still showing some upward mobility in terms of gains since the entire market came to its knees on Tuesday, the 29th of May. On this date, the total market capitalization of the crypto markets came to a recent low of $303 Billion and Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $7,100 levels. The crypto markets have since regained $40 Billion at the moment of writing this and the total market capitalization stands at $345 Billion.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin (BTC) is now trading at $7,629 and looks like it is on its way to levels close to $8,000. With respect to Ethereum, the coin is now valued at $621. Our beloved Ripple (XRP) is currently valued at $0.67 and up 3% in 24 hours. The aforementioned launch of the SBI Virtual Currencies exchange is what many Ripple HODLers were waiting for this summer.&nbsp; Expectations of the platform are high in terms of assisting XRP to reach the <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ripple-xrp-5-usd-possible/">$5 levels</a> everyone is asking about.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Through Ubcoin Market, a person would be able to sell something they own &ndash; such as a second-hand iPhone or a homemade ring &ndash; in exchange for UBC, the platform&rsquo;s native utility token. These tokens can then either be converted into&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> or Ethereum, or be used to make other purchases in the marketplace.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">According to&nbsp;<a  href="https://ubcoin.io/" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Ubcoin Market</a>, this is a compelling alternative to unregulated crypto exchanges, where a person&rsquo;s capital can be in grave danger if the company is hacked.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Its team told Cointelegraph: &ldquo;Everything is legal and secure: the most thorough due diligence executed by Ubcoin&rsquo;s legal team has identified in target countries no direct discrepancies with and violations of the laws of the countries that regulate exchange of owned goods for digital tokens.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>All the operations related to wallet management &mdash; deposits and withdrawals, as well as transactions &mdash; are regulated through Ethereum-based smart contracts. While goods are in transit, the platform holds users&rsquo; tokens in escrow, and they are not released to the seller if the buyer is not happy with the goods. In case anything goes wrong, the deal goes to a two-tier dispute arbitration that is provided by the platform.</p>\n\n<p>The company says it uses neural networks to detect unacceptable texts and images in seller postings. Any accounts showing suspicious patterns of behavior will be blocked. The AI tool will be constantly learning from users&rsquo; actions, content, and complaints.</p>\n\n<h2>Partnerships with tech giants</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The blockchain-based Ubcoin Market is being developed by Ubank, a company which was established in 2009.

The company says this relationship is set to continue and flourish when Ubcoin Market is released, with the platform initially being made available to 2.5 mln active users once it has been integrated into Ubank.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Felix Khachatryan, the CEO of Ubank, said: &ldquo;Our partnership with Samsung is a completely unique story. It is unique in not only that the world&rsquo;s largest mobile phone manufacturer has been steadily collaborating with us on three different projects almost 10 years now, but it has also been encouraging all of our experiments. This kind of opportunity is not given to any other player &ndash; even the most prominent ones &ndash; of the post-Soviet fintech market. That means a lot.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Excitement in Asia</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Ubcoin Market says there is great potential for its product, especially in Asia, which it describes as an &ldquo;extremely fertile ground for the mass adoption of goods-for-cryptocurrency exchanges&rdquo; like theirs.</p>\n\n<p>The company says this assessment has been reflected in the make-up of its contributor base during its ongoing token event &mdash; with contributors from China, Indonesia and South Korea dominating the token generation event so far.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Earlier this month,&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ubcoin-market-receives-investment-from-singapore-based-amereus-group-for-the-expansion-into-the-asian-market">Ubank announced</a> that it had received an undisclosed amount of funding from the Singapore-based VC fund Amereus Group, which is being used to further the development of the Ubcoin Market. The first institutional investor, Inventure Partners, contributed to the project in March.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The platform is scheduled to launch in the Middle East, South Asia and Western Europe in the second and third quarters of 2019, followed by expansion into Latin America and North America by 2020.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Ubcoin Market is currently in the fourth stage of its public token generation event, with a 13 percent discount being offered to contributors.</p>\n\n<div class="row">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div id="post-content">\n<p><span style="font-size: 12px; color: rgb(169, 169, 169);"><span style="font-weight: 600">Disclaimer.</span> Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Although <strong>BTC</strong> remains well below its 50 (blue line) and 200 (red line) day moving averages, the short-term action is somewhat encouraging.</p>\n<p>While the inverted H&amp;S formation requires further work, both investors/traders may want to utilize the following levels as a guide in order to garner further clues/evidence with respect to direction.</p>\n<p>If, at any point in the days ahead, <strong>BTC</strong> can go top-side of the 7730 figure and &lsquo;stick&rsquo; and perhaps more importantly, clear the 8020 level, such development/s, should they materialize, would certainly be a welcome relief and begin to repair some of the recent technical damage despite still trading below both its 50 and 200DMA&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>On the flip-side, if<strong> BTC</strong> is unable to overcome the 7730 level and &lsquo;stick&rsquo; and subsequently &lsquo;takes-out&rsquo; the 7260 level at any time in the days/weeks ahead, such would likely suggest that the potential inverted H&amp;S formation would once again be a failure and would also more than likely precipitate additional selling pressure.</p>\n<p>Thus, while the recent short-term action is encouraging as well as providing some much-needed relief, further work remains before we can declare that <strong>BTC</strong> is out of the woods and in the clear.</p>\n<p>Moving on to Ethereum <strong>(ETH)</strong>, we can see from the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chart</a> below that, much like <strong>BTC</strong>, Ethereum is also forming a potential mini inverted H&amp;S formation and attempting to move up-and-out.</p>\n<p><a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETHUSD.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5934 size-full" src="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETHUSD.png" alt="" width="739" height="396" srcset="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETHUSD.png 739w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETHUSD-300x161.png 300w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETHUSD-370x198.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></p>\n<p>While Ethereum also finds itself trading below both its 50 and 200DMA&rsquo;s, representing a poor technical posture as we can observe above,&nbsp;<strong>ETH</strong>&nbsp;is not nearly as far beneath its moving averages as that of <strong>BTC</strong>.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, if, at any time in the days ahead, <strong>ETH</strong>&nbsp;is capable of clearing the hurdle located at the 650 level and can &lsquo;stick&rsquo;, which coincidentally is where we find the 50-day moving average, such development, should it occur, would certainly be a positive development. On the other side of the ledger, should <strong>ETH</strong> breach the 538 figure, such occurrence would likely render the inverted H&amp;S formation null-and-void.</p>\n<p>Looking at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chart</a>&nbsp;of Litecoin <strong>(LTC)</strong> below, much like both <strong>BTC</strong> as well as <strong>ETH</strong>, Litecoin finds itself in a similar position attempting to move up-and-out of its mini potential inverted H&amp;S formation as well as trading well below both its 50 and 200-day moving averages.</p>\n<p><a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LTCUSD.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5935 size-full" src="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LTCUSD.png" alt="" width="739" height="396" srcset="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LTCUSD.png 739w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LTCUSD-300x161.png 300w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LTCUSD-370x198.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></p>\n<p>When viewing the action of <strong>LTC</strong> above, it&rsquo;s apparent that it finds itself in a similar technical posture as that of both <strong>BTC</strong> and <strong>ETH</strong>.</p>\n<p>Thus, moving forward, both investors/traders may want to monitor the following levels for additional clues/evidence with regards to direction.</p>\n<p>If, at any point in the days ahead,&nbsp;<strong>LTC</strong> is capable of going top-side of the 129.30 level and perhaps more importantly, the 141 figure, such development, should it occur, would surely be a positive step for <strong>LTC</strong>. Whereas, if <strong>LTC</strong> should happen to breach the 114.25 level at any time in the days ahead, such development, should it occur, would suggest that its potential inverted H&amp;S formation would be a failure.</p>\n<p>Last, but certainly not least, we take a look at <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BCHUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Cash</a> below, as <strong>BCH</strong> may just find itself in a better position presently than the aforementioned above.</p>\n<p><a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BCHUSD.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5938 size-full" src="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BCHUSD.png" alt="" width="739" height="396" srcset="https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BCHUSD.png 739w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BCHUSD-300x161.png 300w, https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BCHUSD-370x198.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></p>\n<p>As we can observe from the action above, <strong>BCH</strong>, like <strong>BTC</strong>; <strong>ETH</strong> and <strong>LTC</strong>&nbsp;also find itself in the process of forming its very own potential inverted H&amp;S formation.</p>\n<p>However, unlike <strong>BTC; ETH</strong> as well as <strong>LTC</strong>, which have yet to clear their respective initial hurdles and &lsquo;stick&rsquo; &ndash; thus far,&nbsp;<strong>BCH</strong> has indeed cleared and is holding its initial hurdle located at the 1153 level.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, if <strong>BCH</strong> can continue to hold the 1153 figure and perhaps of more importance, can clear its 50DMA, presently located at the 1244 level, such would certainly go a long way in repairing some of the short-term technical damage that has been inflicted over the past several weeks. On the flip-side of the coin, should <strong>BCH</strong> lose the 941 level at any point in the days ahead, such would more than likely suggest that lower prices are in the offing.</p>\n<p>Thus, of the four names we&rsquo;ve focused on in this report, <strong>BCH</strong> presently finds itself leading the way, while <strong>BTC</strong>; <strong>ETH</strong> as well as <strong>LTC</strong> have further work in order to complete their potential inverted head-and-shoulders formations.</p>\n<p>While the present overall climate finds itself reaping some welcome short-term relief in the absence of storm clouds, as we have suspected, further work remains before we can declare the coast is clear.</p>\n<p>Happy Trading!!</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our <a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

After first announcing his candidacy with the newly formed “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiWcch4dkmE">Cyber Party</a>” (which is not as dirty as it sounds) the viral tycoon joined the race for the Libertarian nomination instead. He polled well among Libertarian primary voters, and came in <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-gary-johnson-libertarian-presidential-nomination-20160529-story.html">second</a> place behind former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>\n<p>After working as a programmer for NASA and Lockheed, McAfee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McAfee#After_McAfee_Associates">struck gold</a> during the first internet boom, when he introduced the antivirus program that still bears his name. He eventually sold the software to Intel, along with his name, before embarking on a spree of sometimes-reckless technology investments. After some bad luck in the ‘90s and 2000’s—with some Trumpian echoes—the $100 million dollar McAfee fortune had shrunk to about $4 million, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/business/economy/21inequality.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>\n<p>By 2008, his fortune seriously in decline, McAfee retired to Belize. By now his reputation had moved from “eccentric tycoon” to “expat weirdo” and rumors of his lifestyle became legendary—from his <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kwn5yy/john-mcafee-bath-salts-belize-murder-fugitive-gregory-faull">predilections</a> for butt drugs and sex yoga, to guns and prostitutes. Eventually McAfee fell afoul of local police on suspicion of murder, or—by his own <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/john-mcafee-what-really-happened-in-belize-2016-5">telling</a>—was framed by corrupt officials,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>leading to a government raid on his compound and a flight to Guatemala.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>\n<p>Somewhere in there, McAfee struck gold again, this time in Bitcoin.

She is also working with IOHK&rsquo;s Chief Scientist, Prof. Aggelos Kiayias at the IOHK research lab at the University of Edinburgh. She spoke about how she came across IOHK and what insisted her on working with them. She also mentions her role, duties, and goals as the Senior Research Manager at IOHK.</p>\n<p>Wester has a background in speech technology and a Ph.D. in automatic speech recognition. For the last 18 months, she has been working with Aggelos on a new project in privacy and security called Panoramix. During the course of this project, she was introduced to IOHK.</p>\n<p>As the senior research manager at IOHK, she will be supporting the senior management in managing the different research streams at IOHK. She will be focussing on the different processes to make sure they are in place, hoping to improve them and making it all more efficient.</p>\n<p>IOHK works with different universities, so there is blockchain technology lab in Edinburgh, where she started off. Last week, she was in Tokyo where she had the opportunity to meet the researcher fellows &#8211; Bernardo, Mario, and the Tokyo tech.</p>\n<p>With the way IOHK has grown in the last year, a lot more management is needed to ensure that the different projects stick to the time frames they need to stick to. It is important and exciting to try to get people to work together and facilitate the collaboration between researchers and developers because they talk different languages and sometimes need help to ensure that their communication is more efficient, says Wester.</p>\n<p>She concluded stating:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So, I hope to contribute to that and make life better for everybody who is working here at IOHK.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cardano and its team have always been focussing on the R7D as much as they do with any other sector of their project. Charles Hoskinson, the Founder of IOHK himself mentioned the importance and the amount of effort that his research team puts all the time to make their currency the best. With a new, experienced research manager to manage some of the most important works of theirs, they look forward to an improvised and much more efficient team.</p>\n<p>Jason Whittle, a speculator commented:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Must be a lot of research going on to need someone to manage it. Nice.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Media 67, a YouTuber says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Welcome Mirjam!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com/cardano-ada-new-research-manager-assures-more-efficiency/">Cardano [ADA]&#8217;s new research manager assures more efficiency</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com">AMBCrypto</a>.</p>',

The project wraps up smart contracts, oracles, and distributed computation, bringing them to the IOTA platform. While other platforms offer distributed computation for a tokenized fee, the IOTA tangle should, in theory, use users&rsquo; resources to be scalable and perform the computations, or complete the smart contracts, for free.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class="twitterembedcontainer">\n<p>IOTA oracles will supply information about the outside world, and tie them to the functioning of smart contracts. While creating a smart contract on many platforms is trivial, creating the right oracles for the contract has been limited in the world of crypto coins. There are expectations that future projects may add tokenization to the IOTA tangle, turning the project into one of the cheapest platforms to serve smart contracts and aid in fast token creation.</p>\n<p>But the expectations that the Qubic launch would be immediate bullish news for IOTA did not materialize, at least in the short term. The market price of MIOTA sank by more than 13% overnight, to $1.71. The big run up for IOTA happened in the days before, still showing a weekly gain of over 19%.</p>\n<p>It seems like a surprise that IOTA has set out to become one of the &ldquo;Ethereum killer&rdquo; projects, with an entirely new product and ecosystem. IOTA has aimed to become the digital asset system for the Internet of Things. However, the real-life applications of IoT have been slow to arrive, and IOTA has lagged behind.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="de">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">IOTA&lsquo;s Qubic is absolutely revolutionary and offers a huge spectrum of potential use cases.

At the moment, MIOTA owners have to rely on exchanges, and simpler wallets that sometimes have trouble finding the balances.</p>\n<p>The IOTA Trinity wallet is currently in beta release, and is seen as one of the indicators of success for the project. Without an intuitive and easy wallet, many crypto coins have lagged in adoption. The Trinity Beta announcement was the reason for the recent spike in IOTA.

Most of the time, it pushes the rivals to their limits, with each of them trying to become better and come out on top. The same goes for the world of cryptos, and this time, we will take a look at how <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-tron-trx-live-up-to-the-hype-despite-crashing-during-the-mainnet-launch/">TRON (TRX)</a> rivals with <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/can-stellar-xlm-replace-ripple-xrp/">Ripple (XRP)</a>.</p>\n<h3>TRON vs Ripple</h3>\n<p>For most of its &ldquo;life&rdquo; TRON was mostly compared to <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ethereum-eth-price-dips-eos-eos-event-responsible-for-the-drop/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, due to the underlying tech of the currencies. Lately, however, a new rivalry has been hinted at, and this one puts TRON against Ripple.</p>\n<p>The two are not exactly traditional rivals, which is obvious once you take a look at what they are trying to achieve. Ripple&rsquo;s aim was always at financial institutions and major banks, and its goal was to become the crypto of choice for entities belonging to this category. <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-the-tron-trx-mainnet-eventually-outshine-ethereums-platform/">TRON</a>, on the other hand, has been focusing on doing the same, but in the sphere of the digital entertainment industry.</p>\n<p>However, even with their focuses being in entirely different fields, these cryptos seem to be a lot alike when it comes to certain sets of features. Since Ripple&rsquo;s development came first, it is more than obvious that TRON&rsquo;s team has done things in a similar way on purpose, by being inspired by Ripple&rsquo;s methods.</p>\n<p>Some of these similarities include low-to-nonexistent transaction fees, great transfer speed, significant liquidity, as well as scalability. Because of this, many are expecting TRON to go as far as to replacing Ripple.</p>\n<h3>Why do we expect so much of TRON?</h3>\n<p>With TRON&rsquo;s successful launch of TestNet, as well as its launch of MainNet only a few days ago, it is obvious that TRON is advancing. Its current price is at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/">$0.060717</a>, and it has yet to rise following the launch of the MainNet. However, there are several other reasons why this currency is expected to succeed Ripple, and become an even bigger name in the world of cryptos.</p>\n<p>The first reason for this is its market utility. Ripple has been known as an industry leader when it comes to offering utility and has managed to hold its own, while many other cryptos have not been able to come anywhere near its heights. Its transaction fees were only a fraction of a penny, which has made Ripple very popular crypto for making transactions.</p>\n<p>However, TRON has managed to come very close to matching this achievement, and it will only continue to improve, now that the MainNet is live. Other than that, it is important to remember that TRON is created so that it can scale. It offers over 1000 transactions per second, which will become one of the most important features after the prices finally stabilize, and we are able to go beyond that issue. Add to that the fact that transactions are basically free, and TRON will easily become one of the best methods of sending money.</p>\n<p>The second reason for TRON&rsquo;s rise is the fact that it has found its own industry where it can dominate. While XRP has been concentrating on banks, TRON went for digital entertainment. This was a smart decision, considering the popularity of gaming around the world, which has been on the rise for decades, now. Another smart thing that TRON did is choosing an industry and sticking to it, instead of trying to tackle as many as it could at the same time.</p>\n<p>The third reason includes the confidence that the crypto is getting from its parent company. For XRP, that is the company Ripple. It owns and controls the crypto, and it doesn&rsquo;t allow anyone else to mine it. Due to its reputation and business strength, the price of XRP has been a bit more stable than those of other cryptos. At the same time, the banks decided that it is worthy of their trust.</p>\n<p>TRON, however, can use the same method of verification thanks to Justin Sun, and the TRON Foundation. Sun has been more than just TRX&rsquo;s creator. He has proven to be an invaluable asset to TRON and was directly responsible for its growth. He has managed to capture the interest of investors and focus it into his crypto. It is safe to say that TRON would not have been nearly as close to its current position if not for Sun and his marketing skills.</p>\n<h3>Coinbase might go for TRON over Ripple</h3>\n<p>Coinbase has been one of the biggest names when it comes to crypto exchanges, and for quite some time, too. Its preference of cryptos has not changed that much over that time, and it has been very picky regarding which coins it will support and offer.</p>\n<p>Lately, however, there were speculations that it might give a chance to several other coins, and it is largely believed that TRON might be the one that will join, rather than Ripple.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons for this potential decision as well. For example, Coinbase&rsquo;s goal is to generate more trading. By accepting TRON, it can easily do this due to its popularity. Also, getting TRON is much cheaper than getting XRP, and the coin still has very high volume. Also, TRON was rumored to be going to a new base in San Francisco, which would make it much closer to Coinbase, which is based in the same city.</p>\n<p>Not to mention the rumor that was later confirmed, and that states that Feng Li, who is an investor in both TRON and Coinbase might have more than enough power to influence this decision. So yes, if TRON gets the opportunity to join Coinbase, it will definitely not waste it, and many believe that this might happen before the year&rsquo;s end.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Making a wrong move would mean losing money, which is not an option for any crypto investor. When it comes to <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/why-you-should-buy-cardano-ada-right-now/">Cardano (ADA)</a> and <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/neo-fails-to-complete-bullish-pennant-pattern/">NEO</a>, making the decision gets even more difficult since both coins have their strong sides. The ultimate coin does not exist as of yet, which means that those willing to invest in cryptos simply have to make due with what is on the table.</p>\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s take a look at Cardano and NEO, and try to determine what can each of these coins offer, so that you can decide for yourself which one is worthy of your time.</p>\n<h2>NEO vs Cardano</h2>\n<h3>About NEO</h3>\n<p>We will start by taking a look at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/">NEO </a>first. Originally, it was called Antshares, and it was launched in 2014, in China. Because of the way it was built, it was called Ethereum of China, since it tries to provide its users with a specific set of functionalities. It has not received much attention in the West until recently, and many people have barely even heard of it. However, NEO is pretty big in the East.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, it is pretty similar to Ethereum, and its goal is to digitize the economic system on the global level. It plans to do so by providing a strongly-decentralized infrastructure for pushing smart contracts, which is also explained in its whitepaper.</p>\n<p>Now, smart contracts have been around for a while now, and Ethereum&rsquo;s platform has mostly been seen as their strongest proponent. Basically, they are a piece of code which has a purpose to determine if a transaction is legitimate, and whether or not it should be completed.</p>\n<p>Its founders are core developer Zhang Zhengwen and Da Hongfei, but it is also backed by <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/waltonchain-wtc-winning-awards-and-partnerships/">OnChain</a>, which is a firm set up by its founders in order to make sure that everything will work as it should. The founders are, to this day, very supportive of NEO, and are often visiting various meetups, events, and alike.</p>\n<p>So, what is it that makes NEO so great? Well, not its technology or features that it can offer. To clarify &ndash; we are not saying that any of it is bad or that it doesn&rsquo;t work. However, the fact is that NEO simply doesn&rsquo;t have anything revolutionary. Its biggest strength is the fact that is accepted by China, which has become infamous as a country where cryptos don&rsquo;t receive much love. NEO has managed to grow in a country like that, which is almost a unique feature these days, and that is where its main power lies.</p>\n<h3>About Cardano (ADA)</h3>\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/">Cardano</a>. It started its operations back in 2015, almost at the very end of the year. This timing, as well as its technology, are making it fall under the third wave of cryptos. Its developers have decided to make a crypto that will use the knowledge of its predecessors, which is why ADA is a mix of various design principles. Their goal was to make a crypto that will be capable to overcome regular obstacles that have still turned out to be lethal to many currencies. Eventually, their goal for ADA was to make it strong enough to rival even BTC itself.</p>\n<p>It was developed by Ethereum&rsquo;s co-founder and ex-CEO, Charles Hoskinson, and its main goal is to provide smart contracts that would rely on its own ADA coins. For a long time, this coin has been concentrating on developing and improving its own technology, so that its services would become flawless. Its team is yet another of ADA&rsquo;s advantages since it is made up of academics, professors, and other kinds of professionals who really know what they are doing. This is one of the most important parts of the crypto since its future cannot exist without the right people backing it up.</p>\n<p>And, while we are talking about Cardano supporters, there are several of them, but three major organizations are among the strongest ones. Those are The Cardano foundation, IOHK, and Emurgo. Each of them has contributed to this coin in its own way. The Cardano Foundation has promoted it and help create its community, as well as teach the members about cryptos. IOHK is responsible for ADA&rsquo;s technology, while Emurgo is the entity responsible for the integration of Cardano&rsquo;s platform into various businesses.</p>\n<p>So, what is it that makes Cardano special?</p>\n<p>Right now, the answer is &ndash; its protocols and features. Cardano has some pretty unique aspects, which include Proof-of-Stake protocol. layered tech, the use of two wallets, coding language, governance model, and alike.</p>\n<p>Even with all of this, Cardano has yet to develop, and it has a lot of potentials to become even stronger, bigger, and more powerful than it is right now. Its team knows what it is doing, its community is thriving, and more and more people are beginning to see its potential.</p>\n<h3>Which one is better?</h3>\n<p>It is hard to answer this question since both of these cryptos have their own strengths and weaknesses. They both seem to compete with Ethereum to some extent, but neither of them is good enough to surpass it at this point. In the future &ndash; perhaps, but not right now. In the end, nobody can know what will happen in a few years, and which of these coins will come up on top.</p>\n<p>The only thing that we can be certain of is that they are not wasting their potential, and both of them are doing as best as they can to develop their strengths and provide the best service. Everything else is up to the investors and their own preference.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Do you want to make a cool $10 Million between now and the 24th of June this year? Well, Justin Sun and the <a href="https://tron.network/index?lng=en">Tron (TRX)</a> Foundation are offering a bug bounty reward of up to $10 Million for anyone who will find technical vulnerabilities in the TRON MainNet.</p>\n<h4>But first, let us define ethical hacking.</h4>\n<p><a href="http://wiki.cas.mcmaster.ca/index.php/Ethical_Hacking"><b>Ethical Hacking</b></a>, also known as&nbsp;penetration testing,&nbsp;intrusion testing, or&nbsp;red teaming, is the controversial act of locating weaknesses and vulnerabilities of computer and information systems by duplicating the intent and actions of malicious&nbsp;hackers.</p>\n<p>It is with this background that Justin Sun made the announcement of the $10 Million bug bounty via twitter when he said <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1002543756078223361">the following</a>:</p>\n<p><em><strong>&ldquo;TRON Bug Bounty Program with a highest reward of USD$10 million. We take the security of <s>#</s>TRON mainnet very seriously. If you have made an important discovery of potential bugs, please contact us and join the TRON Bug Bounty Program&rdquo;</strong></em></p>\n<p>The TRON MainNet, also known as Odyssey v2.0, is currently available <a href="https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/releases">on GitHub</a> for download and testing.</p>\n<p>Refreshing our memories on recent vulnerabilities discovered in both the Ethereum and EOS platforms, one can understand why the reward has been set so high. Standard blockchain platforms include sensitive user data along with the transaction records that can be manipulated by a rogue hacker. One needs only refer to the recent Verge (XVG) hacks that have left users and fans of the entire crypto-verse shaken.</p>\n<p>In the case of EOS&rsquo; MainNet, the platform was recently found <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-eos-will-weather-the-storm-of-vulnerabilities-and-come-out-stronger/">to contain security vulnerabilities</a> to the level of causing a possible full-blown cyber attack, all a rogue hackers had to do, was to create a smart contract that took control of all the nodes on the platform. The nodes would, in turn, be used to mine other cryptocurrency networks and cause the full cyber attack earlier mentioned.</p>\n<p>Justin Sun and the Tron Foundation have done the right thing by initiation a bug bounty program to guarantee the platform is secure before token migration starts on the 21st of June and the Genesis block is launched on the 25th of the same month.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The OpenPayFX comes at a time when bank customers live a busy lifestyle and want banking options on the go rather than queuing at a bank or ATM. OpenPayFX does just that and leads the way in terms of fintech solutions on the blockchain.

As the Ripple solutions continue being adopted by banks and financial institutions, it might be safe to conclude that XRP might eventually become <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/does-ripple-xrp-have-a-shot-at-becoming-a-global-reserve-currency/">the global reserve currency</a> for central banks.</p>\n<p>Current market analysis indicates XRP is still trying to get a footing in this volatile times of crypto trading. The coin is currently trading at $0.612 at the moment of writing this and down less than a percentage point in the last 24 hours.

On June 1, 2018, Pedro Moreno-Sanchez appeared in a Cypherpunks 101 <a title="" href="https://youtu.be/dGpoXxAiBuI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> where shared his ideas and journey into the world of securing bitcoin and its blockchain. He believes that the <a title="" href="https://btcmanager.com/tag/cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a> has a great future and it will eventually be accepted as a currency for payment.</p>\n<h2>Early Beginnings in the Crypto World</h2>\n<p>Moreno-Sanchez was pursuing his Ph.D. at Saarland University in April 2013 under the supervision of Aniket Kate when he first heard of <a title="" href="http://bitcoin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin</a>. It was his mentor Aniket who introduced him to cryptocurrencies for the very first time.</p>\n<p>The concept was new for Moreno-Sanchez, but he found it interesting that a new way of sending payments over the internet could be developed. Since he came from a background of working and solving networking problems, the idea of a global decentralized currency appealed more to him.</p>\n<p>He started learning more about bitcoin and blockchain and eventually, his first paper was addressed a security issue in IoT products. He has since contributed to <a title="" href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pmorenos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 research papers</a> mainly dealing with increasing privacy across cryptocurrency networks.</p>\n<h2>Research Paper for CoinShuffle Released in 2014</h2>\n<p>In September 2014, Moreno-Sanchez along with his mentor Aniket Kate and another scholar Tim Ruffing authored a paper in which they proposed a new system to increase the privacy of users. The proposed idea, if implemented, would make it impossible for anyone to track the history of a coin or to conclude who the owner of each coin is.</p>\n<p>It was stated, “In this paper, we propose CoinShuﬄe, a completely decentralized Bitcoin mixing protocol that allows users to utilize Bitcoin in a truly anonymous manner.” It was based on the accountable anonymous group communication protocol <a title="" href="http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dissent</a> and claimed to be better than most previous attempts made to address this issue.</p>\n<p>Suppose there is one user sitting exactly at the every edge of an n-sided pentagon. Every user has one coin with him and he does not know who are the other users sitting next to him. All these users then randomly pass their coins in a predefined manner such that no user is left with his original coin. At the end, every user will have one coin but it will be different from the original coin he originally had.By mixing coins of several users and then transfers them a new set of coins from the mixed coins, CoinShuffle can achieve an improvement in privacy. </p>\n<p>Previous attempts made to enhance the privacy of users by mixing coins would use a centralized server which would increase the risk of the network failing or getting tampered with. CoinShuffle, however, used a <a title="" href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/02fd/71524e15de535d5e7aa6f79743352cac3992.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">P2P mixing</a> protocol that had no central server as it was mixing the coins among users who were doing the actual work.</p>\n<h2>Limitations of CoinShuffle Led to CoinShuffle++</h2>\n<p>The idea to let users work and mix their coins with each other worked fine for a small set of users, but the problem grew when it was tested among large users, as it increased the time it took to perform the operations by each user in a linear fashion.</p>\n<p>Moreno-Sanchez says, “The system worked fine for a less number of users but it would take almost seven minutes if there were 50 users who were part of the network.”</p>\n<p>Due to this limitation, it was impossible to roll out a working model for bitcoin as the cryptocurrency’s blockchain would process several thousands of transactions every day among all its users.</p>\n<p>To do away with the disadvantage, Moreno-Sanchez and his team envisioned CoinShuffle++, which modified the protocol slightly to change the linear nature and perform the operations all at once instead . Praising it, he said, “It would take us seven minutes with 50 users, but now it took us less than seven seconds even with 100 plus users.”</p>\n<h2>ValueShuffle</h2>\n<p>ValueShuffle was then conceptualized in a <a title="" href="https://people.mmci.uni-saarland.de/~truffing/papers/valueshuffle.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research paper</a> ‘Mixing Conﬁdential Transactions: Comprehensive Transaction Privacy for Bitcoin’ in 2017 and is an extension of CoinShuffle++. It successfully combines coin mixing, and two partial privacy solutions namely Stealth Addresses and Confidential Transactions (CT). Since with CoinShuffle++ the amounts were public, the shuffle required users to have the same numbers of bitcoins. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>“The combination of technologies provides the privacy guarantees of interest in Bitcoin. ValueShuﬄe ensures that no attacker observing the blockchain or the network, or even participating in the protocol, can link inputs and outputs of the CoinJoin transaction created in an execution of ValueShuﬄe.”</b><b></b></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once CT is available on Bitcoin, ValueShuffle can be easily integrated, &#8220;&#8230;we can directly apply ValueShuffle, we not only get the performance of CoinShuffle++ but we also manage to hide the amounts being shuffled and certain other properties associated with CT,&#8221; Moreno-Sanchez remarked.</p>\n<p>On his thoughts about the timeframe surrounding the implementation of CT, he said from a technical point of view, &#8220;there are not any technical challenges or disadvantages with CT, and I hope in the next few months it will be accepted and integrated.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Moreno-Sanchez is bullish on the future of bitcoin, saying that researchers are really interested in the protocol, it would become a widely adopted currency soon serving as an alternative for payments. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com/pedro-moreno-sanchez-speaks-about-coinshuffle-and-the-future-of-bitcoin/">Pedro Moreno-Sanchez Speaks About CoinShuffle and the Future of Bitcoin</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://btcmanager.com">BTCMANAGER</a>.</p>',

As is usual with any launch, Justin Sun was there to inspire the Tron fans and HODLers and reiterate the vision of the project to decentralize the web. The recording of the live event has been uploaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJo7bCXgzao">on Youtube</a> for you to re-watch. Justin would later accompany the MainNet event with further outlining the vision of TRON as an Independent blockchain from Ethereum&rsquo;s.</p>\n<h5>The big question is, and with the enthusiasm of the Tron team, will Tron (TRX) eventually outshine Ethereum?</h5>\n<h5>The next question is, how will TRON achieve that?</h5>\n<p>To begin with, and outlined by Justin Sun in <a href="https://medium.com/@Tronfoundation/letter-to-the-community-odyssey-2-0-7e440100c463">the letter</a> to the Tron members, the Tron MainNet platform will be different than Ethereum&rsquo;s due to the fact that it is built using the Java programming language. This means it is easier to program on the TRON Odyssey V2.0 platform than it is for a developer to learn the Solidity programming language necessary to create Decentralized Apps on the Ethereum platform.</p>\n<p>Still, on the needs of the developer, the <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-still-a-fan-favorite-and-a-safe-bet-moving-forward/">TRON</a> platform can handle more transactions per second (TPS) and hence obliterating network congestion as seen on ETH during the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/loveable-digital-kittens-clogging-ethereums-blockchain/">Crypto-Kitties</a> launch last year. This, in turn, makes it a favorite for any developer who wants to create the next level of fast DApps.</p>\n<p>The second reason the TRON MainNet might outshine Ethereum is the new concept of democratizing the platform using Super Representation. Any TRX can leverage his/her coins so as to be part of the decision making in the community. This is the complete opposite of the ETH platform where the foundation makes all the decisions. By allowing for true decentralization, users know their input is going to be considered and implemented in a democratic manner.</p>\n<p>The third, and most likely the biggest reason TRON MainNet might outshine Ethereum&rsquo;s platform, is the amount of community support the project has gathered. Currently, TRON Odyssey 2.0 has accumulated 2,153 commits on <a href="https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/releases">Github</a>, merged 547 forks, released 15 software iterations, and added 102 new features. The team has also performed 384 unit tests, 461 function tests and managed to scrutinize the code to guarantee it is secure for release.</p>\n<p>Also to add, and with respect to the Tron Community, is that TRX holders number 1.08 Million compared to EOS&rsquo; holders who number 306,000. This makes TRON the project with the highest HODLers on the ETH platform who will soon migrate to the MainNet by the 25th of June. Justin also has over 448,000 followers on Twitter and the project has over 3.82 Million related videos on youtube. This means that the community support is unlike no other.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-tron-trx-live-up-to-the-hype-despite-crashing-during-the-mainnet-launch/">Tron</a> project might end up eventually eclipsing its parent platform, Ethereum, due to the reasons highlighted above. Current market analysis shows that TRX is yet to pick up in the crypto-market after the MainNet launch a few days ago. TRX is currently valued at $0.058 at the moment of writing this and down almost 5% in 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The company offers many different cryptocurrency pairs. Their presence also spans many countries around the world, including Japan. Unfortunately, it appears that latter aspect will come to change fairly soon. Due to looming friction with local authorities, HitBTC will <a href="https://blog.hitbtc.com/hitbtc-is-preparing-to-launch-a-regulated-subsidiary-in-japan/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">suspend</a> its service in the region.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most people know exchanges operating in Japan need to obtain authorization from regulators. That process also involves obtaining a specific </span><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/30/japans-fsa-is-pressuring-exchanges-to-drop-cryptocurrencies-favoured-by-criminals/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">license</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. As of right now, HitBTC does not have such a license. Nor do they plan to obtain one, by the look of things. The logical outcome is to suspend the services provided in the country until further notice.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyone visiting the site with a Japanese IP address will need to provide residency details. If they can prove they do not reside in Japan, accessing the platform will remain possible. Otherwise, they will have to look for a different trading platform supporting cryptocurrencies.  There is no shortage of such companies in Japan, though.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Other Exchanges to Follow?</b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Domestic exchanges in Japan usually go through the licensing process without problems. Over a dozen companies are licensed, with a handful more to be granted a license in the weeks to come. For foreign companies such as HitBTC, the situation is a bit different. There&#8217;s also the fact the company offers Monero trading, which has become a topic of </span><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/04/japanese-fsa-discriminating-anonymous-cryptocurrencies-shows-why-decentralized-exchanges-are-needed/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">debate </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">among Japanese regulators. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not the first bigger trading platform to leave Japan either. Kraken, one of the world&#8217;s bigger exchanges, took the same steps in April of 2018. According to officials, Kraken made this choice based on &#8220;rising costs&#8221; rather than licensing issues. Even so, it shows foreign trading platforms will have some tough decisions to make moving forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Binance has also been warned about its lack of an official license. Whether or not they will pursue this regulatory requirement, remains a bit unclear as of right now. HitBTC is in the process of making a return to Japan in the future, though. For now, the company is working with a Japanese law firm to go through the licensing process.  It remains unclear how long that process may take.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<pre>Image from Shutterstock</pre>\n</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/04/hitbtc-temporarily-suspends-services-japan-licensing-process/" data-wpel-link="internal">HitBTC Temporarily Suspends Services in Japan During Licensing Process</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsbtc.com" data-wpel-link="internal">NewsBTC</a>.</p>',

In fact I would strongly disagree with that&hellip; [what&rsquo;s more], cryptocurrencies can be traced, unlike fiat currencies [cash].&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As CT&rsquo;s correspondent noted, the notion that transactions involving crypto are in fact more traceable than fiat currencies can seem counterintuitive, given that achieving <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-anonymous-is-the-purchase-of-crypto-regulations-practice-risks">anonymity</a> was one of the motivating impulses behind the invention of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<p>Buchanan, however, stressed that there are now many &ldquo;commercially available&rdquo; tools that law enforcement can leverage to trace how currency has moved on a blockchain. She mentioned blockchain-specific intelligence systems such as <a  href="https://www.elliptic.co" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Elliptic</a> and <a  href="https://www.chainalysis.com" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chainalysis</a> as prominent examples.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, Buchanan admitted that law enforcement &ldquo;has a lot of catching up to do,&rdquo; likening the challenge to the early days of the internet. She suggested that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-cftc-irs-and-others-a-guide-to-us-regulating-bodies">regulators</a>, too, will need to &ldquo;update&rdquo; their practices in order to &ldquo;keep pace,&rdquo; as the outdated <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/bytom-passed-the-sec-howey-test-becomes-the-first-non-securities-public-blockchain-project-in-the-usa">legislation</a> introduced in the early 20th century for traditional securities is proving itself an awkward fit for 21st century innovations.</p>\n\n<p>Buchanan is currently serving as a General Counsel to major <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency-exchange">crypto exchange</a> <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/kraken">Kraken</a>, and says she has been &ldquo;very involved&rdquo; in the crypto industry for the past four to five years. She advocated cryptocurrencies as a &ldquo;wonderful tool&rdquo; that provides a &ldquo;cost-effective&rdquo; means for the transfer of value globally. When asked about the future of crypto <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/adoption">adoption</a>, Buchanan considered that we&rsquo;re &ldquo;already&rdquo; seeing it &ldquo;around the world,&rdquo; suggesting its increasing use by <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-blockchain-is-banking-the-unbanked">unbanked</a> populations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As a recent Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-vs-cash-how-the-numbers-stack-up-on-drugs-guns-murders">report</a> showed, cryptocurrencies are indisputably exploited for illicit ends, with an early 2018 paper estimating that &ldquo;approximately one-quarter of all users... and close to one-half of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> transactions...are associated with illegal activity.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>However, these findings, when placed within a broader context, fall into a more nuanced light. Whereas global illicit Bitcoin activity annually is estimated at a value of around $72 bln, the same paper cites figures for 2010 that reveal that $100 bln in fiat was spent on drugs in the US alone.</p>\n</p>',

There are many reasons why investors should consider NEO, which has a very large untapped potential. Let&rsquo;s explore some of them, so that you might get a better view of its situation.</p>\n<h3>About NEO</h3>\n<p>NEO originally came to be under the name of Antshares. Saying that it is a lesser crypto might not be doing it justice, since it is still among the top 15, with the rank of 11 according to the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/">CoinMarketCap</a>. Just like other cryptos, NEO has experienced both a large rise and a though fall when the market value of cryptos dropped at the beginning of 2018. Its current price is $54.50, which is not bad, considering that there are a lot of other digital currencies that have suffered more or even completely disappeared due to their losses.</p>\n<p>Despite all that has happened, NEO still has a very large potential to become the next king of cryptos, and it might even happen during this very year. It might seem unlikely at first, which is why we will now explore a few reasons that might confirm this, at least as a valid possibility.</p>\n<h3>NEO&rsquo;s ICO plan</h3>\n<p>NEO has had a very large success when it comes to <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/the-7-golden-icos-to-shine-in-q2-of-2018/">ICOs</a> so far. It managed to reach 800% of its growth, and it has proven to be one of the best ways for large companies to get funds for their businesses. It scheduled a number of them in the days to come, and it already held a lot of successful ones in the past. Despite the general mistrust of ICOs around the world, in NEO&rsquo;s case, this will be one of the biggest forces that will help it achieve greatness.</p>\n<h3>Smart handling of Smart Contracts</h3>\n<p>NEO is, of course, a cryptocurrency, but that is not all it is. Some would argue that it is, first and foremost, a platform. As a platform, it had a lot of success as well, and it has proven to be safe and trustworthy. It can offer a secure and stable blockchain, which allows for the creation of dApps and smart contracts.</p>\n<p>More and more people are beginning to realize that smart contracts are one of the most important aspects of these new technologies, and NEO is right there with <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/ethereum-eth-price-dips-eos-eos-event-responsible-for-the-drop/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> in this regard. Smart contracts and blockchain tech, in general, hold a lot of potentials, not just for cryptos, but for various businesses, as well as for solving many really big problems in the world.</p>\n<h3>It doesn&rsquo;t have a strong presence in exchanges</h3>\n<p>This one might be a bit controversial, and many are wondering how can this be a good thing? Well, it is, since NEO&rsquo;s whole thing is relying on revenue received from blockchain investments. Sure, the trading value would be a nice bonus, but it is not NEO&rsquo;s primary goal. Since it is not that popular with exchanges, it can rely on honest partnerships with those who seek its stability and growth over time. A lot of cryptos have a problem with bullish investors who simply seek to make a profit as quickly as possible, and sometimes, this works out. Most of the time, however, the crypto gets a large but false sense of support, which could lead to ruin.</p>\n<h3>Community and support</h3>\n<p>Over time, NEO has managed to develop quite a large community, especially during the crypto hype of 2017. Just like other cryptos, NEO has grown as a project at this time, which has caught the attention of a lot of people. If you are familiar with cryptos at all, you certainly know that having a community that will support a crypto and spread the awareness can be crucial in the times of trouble, especially for smaller coins.</p>\n<p>Another very important thing is the fact that NEO is supported by China and its government. This has even gone as far as for NEO to be called Chinese Ethereum. This does not mean that its focus is solely on the Chinese market, however, and NEO makes quite an effort to expand and provide its services to anyone and everyone willing to accept them. Still, support from such a large force can&rsquo;t hurt.</p>\n<p>China became infamous in the world of cryptos after it started banning exchanges, crypto trade, and a lot of things related to cryptos in general. Still, it seems to have a soft spot for NEO, and it certainly won&rsquo;t miss an opportunity to join and explore technology with such large potential. Right now, China is still trying to figure out a way to regulate cryptos and ICOs, which is a good thing. An even better thing is that it has always worked well with NEO, which might end up being this entire country&rsquo;s crypto of choice some day.</p>\n<p>All in all, NEO is a crypto on the rise, with its efforts being focused on many different aspects of the crypto world. It might not be as popular as Bitcoin, <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/why-nano-nano-is-a-safer-bet-than-litecoin-ltc/">Litecoin</a>, or even <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-tron-trx-live-up-to-the-hype-despite-crashing-during-the-mainnet-launch/">TRON</a> (especially these days), but the market is still young, and very, very far from being fully developed. Some time is necessary for the truly capable cryptos to reach their full potential and rise from the large sea of various currencies. Still, that time will come, and when it does, you&rsquo;d want to be caught supporting the ones that can go far, which is definitely a category NEO belongs in.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

        content: '<div class="optinengine_before_post"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IOTA’s much anticipated Qubic finally made its appearance as the team revealed a few of its details for the IOTA community and its investors. However, unlike last time, IOTA coin bulls didn&#8217;t make an appearance, rather MIOTA declined by 11 percent amidst the red market. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Qubic: Messaging and payment system</b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, IOTA revealed its much anticipated <strong>Qubic protocol</strong>. After weeks of speculation, what was touted as the most important development in the history of the IOTA made its way to the public. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the official website, <a href="https://coingape.com/iota-tedx-talk-attract-new-partners-mergers/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qubic </a>is described as </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“a protocol that specifies IOTA&#8217;s solution for oracle machines, smart contracts, outsourced computations, and more.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team didn&#8217;t go all out with the details, but the IOTA community and investors did get to know more about the project. However, the developments for the same are still being worked on. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The official tweet from IOTA read: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Qubic platform will be the most significant contribution to the IOTA stack, it will enable unlimited new use cases and turn the IOTA Project into a full solution. Information and details are beginning to be unveiled right now at http://qubic.iota.org </span>#IOTA #Qubic.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further clearing the air around it being an individual currency on its own, IOTA states: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Qubic is not a new token or coin; there will be no Qubic ICO or airdrop.” </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qubic is basically an application that is to improve the existing IOTA model. To be exact, </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the most apparent change is that there now exists a working protocol to serve as the messaging and payment system: IOTA.”</span></em></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about the original Qubic idea which had several severe issues, now Qubic is following the IOTA standards for “IoT messaging and payments”. Through “fee-free IOTA transactions”, this has been made possible.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Also, read: <a title="VeChain Collaborates with Private Firms to Make VeChainThor Blockchain Rock Solid" href="https://coingape.com/vechain-make-vechainthor-blockchain-solid/?utm_source=read_more&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="bookmark">VeChain Collaborates with Private Firms to Make VeChainThor Blockchain Rock Solid</a></strong></span></em></p>\n<h3><b>IOTA coin bears take over bulls</b></h3>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The much awaited and anticipated announcement of Qubic was expected to pump IOTA price, however, what happened was actually the opposite. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last time, the IOTA coin Foundation gave a sneak peak of Qubic, <a href="https://coingape.com/iota-price-high-with-trinity-wallet-release/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIOTA </a>price took a huge jump, unlike, this time. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the fact is <a href="https://coingape.com/gibraltar-blockchain-exchange-launch/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> doesn’t work according to the usual and expected sentiments. Moreover, the majority of the market is currently experiencing the red. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IOTA is at $1.74 with a drop down of about 11 percent in the past 24-hours. At the 9th position, IOTA’s market cap is about $4.8 billion. Moreover, the scope of the Qubic has been extended with its development underway.  It can be expected that once the greens enter the market, IOTA coin will see a nice rise in the wake of its latest developments and announcements. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Do you think IOTA developments will increase its market value?

        title: '‘Sharding and Plasma to Help Ethereum Reach 1M Transactions per Second,’ Says Vitalik Buterin',
        content: '<p>From the very beginning, two major blockchain networks of Bitcoin and Ethereum have been facing the limited processing speed required for nodes to validate transactions executed on the networks. Considering the continuously growing community of cryptocurrency holders, the low transaction rate as well as increased operational costs have become a significant obstacle for the everyday usage of digital assets.</p>\n<p>The current speed of Bitcoin transactions is only 7 transactions per second, while Ethereum can process up to 15 transactions at peak capacity. However, even when Ethereum is able to execute twice the amount of Bitcoin transactions, it is still not good enough in order to shatter the highly set benchmark of the cost of transactions available on blockchain.</p>\n<p>In an effort to overcome issues with network congestion and overall throughput, the founder of Ethereum has announced two layer improvements, Sharding and Plasma, conceived to boost the network’s transaction capacity. Buterin claims it is only a matter of time until these primary solutions working in tandem will enable the Ethereum network to process upwards of a million transactions per second.</p>\n<p>Sharding represents a scaling solution that splits blockchain networks into smaller partitions called shards, which contain independent transaction history. In this scenario, individual nodes would only have to process transactions for certain shards, hence allowing the overall transactional throughput to be greater as a single node wouldn’t have to do all the work.</p>\n<p>Plasma, on the other hand, is designated to be a solution for conducting off-chain transactions that does not improve the blockchain itself, instead it takes an existing blockchain and creates a special construction, which is connected to it, and thus provides a much higher throughput. Nevertheless, as it relies on the underlying blockchain of Ethereum, Plasma allows the Ethereum blockchain to continue handling smart contracts and guarantee an advanced layer of security while only broadcasting completed transactions.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the technology, Buterin explained how the two solutions work in complement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If you have a Sharding solution, the Sharding solution itself might increase the scalability of Ethereum by a factor of 100, or eventually even more. But then, if you do Plasma on top of the scalability solution, then what that means is, you’re not just doing 100 times of the amount of activity but you are doing 100 times the amount of entrances, the amount of exits, and despite resolutions.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the recent OmiseGO AMA session hosting Buterin, Sharding and Plasma had already been tested on the Ethereum testnet to support potential decentralized applications (dApps) with millions of users by taking an innovative approach in optimizing the blockchain.</p>\n<p>It is worth to mention that the other day one of the best business conferences, Nordic Business Forum, has nominated Buterin amidst the 25 most promising, successful, and deservedly enviable entrepreneurs under the age of 25 in Northern Europe. The selection criteria adjusts this nomination to a dedicated group of people who is stepping up to challenge the odds and create new solutions that improve lives and create positive change.</p>\n<p>The news especially flatters the supporters of Ethereum who now obtained an addition reason to be proud of. However, at the moment Buterin has made no comments on his nomination.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinspeaker.com/2018/06/04/sharding-plasma-help-ethereum-reach-1m-transactions-per-second-says-vitalik-buterin/">&#8216;Sharding and Plasma to Help Ethereum Reach 1M Transactions per Second,&#8217; Says Vitalik Buterin</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinspeaker.com">CoinSpeaker</a>.</p>',

Users have a deadline of June 25 to comply with the new features.</p>\n<p>The May 31 MainNet launch was a unanimous decision to <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/eos-tron-erc20-migration-affect-on-ethereum/">leave Ethereum</a>&rsquo;s in-fighting about community governance as well as &ldquo;high gas tariffs and archaic gas burn mechanism,&rdquo; according to a press release by Tron Foundation.</p>\n<h3>Investors to Wait Longer for Rally</h3>\n<p>However, amidst the excitement and buzz that accompanied the launch of Tron&rsquo;s Odyssey 2.0, there are fears that Tron&rsquo;s prices might further soar following a drop of over 9.7% in the last seven days. Today, Tron&rsquo;s price is at $0.059 while it was at $0.073 on May 26. Additionally, <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/will-tron-trx-go-as-far-as-3-usd/">TRX</a> is one of the few top 10 virtual currencies that are depreciating in what is an otherwise pool of green.</p>\n<p>Experts are blaming the surge to what they regard as brilliant marketing by the Tron team that managed to heighten expectation, confidence, and awareness of the token.</p>\n<p>But now that the hype is subsiding, Tron needs to actualize real results and meet the high expectation or else it will disappear from the cryptocurrency radar faster than it appeared on it. On the other hand, long-term investors are ignoring the recent shortcomings and are focusing on the long-term prospects.</p>\n<h3>What Next for Tron?</h3>\n<p>Actions that are expected have a positive effect on Tron after launching Odyssey 2.0 include:</p>\n<h4>The Inclusion of More dApps on Tron</h4>\n<p><a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-2018-expected-price-growth/">Tron (TRX)</a> seems to be aligning itself at a vantage point to capture Ethereum&rsquo;s customer base as lack of scalability and transaction costs continue to trouble the investor of smart contracts.</p>\n<p>Odyssey 2.0, Tron&rsquo;s new main net, increases the overall throughput of the platform to over 1000 TPS while charging little or no cost for transactions.</p>\n<p>If you compare the two, you will see that Tron solves Ethereum&rsquo;s &lt;25TPS issue and high transaction rate challenge by offering a better platform to build and develop decentralized applications.</p>\n<h4>Trading Volumes to Increase</h4>\n<p>Even though daily <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/go-for-tron-trx-or-lose-otherwise/">TRX</a> volumes being traded are yet to match the highs of the over $3.8 billion worth of Tron that were traded on a single day early this year, the current volume of about $700 million is predicted to pass the billion-dollar mark as the new Main Net settles down.</p>\n<h4>Election of Super Representatives</h4>\n<p>Super Representatives are argued to play a role in stabilizing and improving the value of <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-bullish-trend-can-it-keep-going-up/">TRX</a> by representing the will of contributors to the project and providing the much-awaited governance of the project.</p>\n<p>All in all, not just the above-mentioned factors will bring in&nbsp;<a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-holders-will-taste-success-soon/">Tron&rsquo;s rally shortly</a>, the project has put together a number of things in a &lsquo;right&rsquo; way &ndash; so it will only go up. The enormous investment Tron has received cannot make it die easily. Prices are expected to appreciate within the month with an all-time high expected to take place at the end of June.</p>\n<p><strong>For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/globalcoinreport">Telegram</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The ideologically driven crowd started to organize through a mailing list centred around privacy-enhancing technologies. Like Dwork and Naor, these “Cypherpunks” — as they would come to be called — utilized the relatively new science of cryptography to work toward their goals.</p><p>Over the years, Adam Back — who earned his Ph.D. in 1996 — established himself as one of the more active participants on this list, at times contributing dozens of emails in a single month. Like most Cypherpunks, the cryptographer was passionate about topics including<a href="http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1997/03/msg00586.html"> privacy</a>,<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/09/msg00407.html"> free speech</a> and<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/09/msg01919.html"> libertarianism</a>, and engaged in technical discussions pertaining<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/07/msg00851.html"> to anonymous remailers</a>,<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/07/msg00836.html"> encrypted file systems</a>,<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/09/msg01919.html"> electronic cash</a> as<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/genesis-files-how-david-chaums-ecash-spawned-cypherpunk-dream/"> introduced</a> by Dr. David Chaum, and more.</p><p>But for a while, Back was perhaps best known for printing and selling “munition” shirts: T-shirts with an encryption protocol printed on them, intended to help point out the absurd decision by the U.S. government to regulate Phil Zimmermann’s PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption program as “munitions” within the definition of the U.S. export regulations. Wearing Back’s shirt while crossing the border to exit the United States technically made you a “munitions exporter.”</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/munitions_tshirt.original.jpg" width="990" height="550" alt="munitions tshirt"><br/></p><p>Like many, Back was <a href="http://datwww.mit.edu/bloom-picayune/crypto/2058">not aware</a> of Dwork and Naor’s proof-of-work proposal. But by the mid-1990s, he was thinking of similar ideas to counter spam, sometimes “out loud” on the Cypherpunks mailing list.</p><p>“A side benefit of using PGP, is that PGP encryption should add some overhead to the spammer — he can probably encrypt less messages per second than he can spam down a T3 link,” Back<a data-original-title="" href="http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1997/03/msg00631.html"> commented</a>, for example, in the context of adding more privacy to remailers; an idea somewhat similar to Dwork and Naor’s.</p><p>The Cypherpunks mailing list grew significantly in about half a decade. What started out as an online discussion platform for a group of people that initially gathered at one of their startups in the Bay Area became a small internet phenomenon with thousands of subscribers — and often more emails on a single day than anyone could reasonably keep track of.</p><p>It was around this time — 1997, close to the list’s peak popularity — that Back submitted his Hashcash proposal.</p><h4>Hashcash</h4><p>Hashcah is similar to Dwork and Naor’s anti-spam proposal and has the same purpose, though Back proposed some additional use cases like countering anonymous remailer abuse. But as the name suggests, Hashcash was not based on cryptographic puzzles like Dwork and Naor’s; it was based on hashing.</p><p>Hashing is a cryptographic trick that takes any data — whether it’s a single letter or an entire book — and turns it into a seemingly random number of predetermined length.</p>For example, a SHA-256 hash of the sentence <i>This is a sentence</i> produces this hexadecimal number:<p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_9.06.43_AM.original.png" width="1250" height="48" alt="hash1"><br/></p><p></p><p>Which can be “translated” to the regular decimal number:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_8.55.03_AM.original.png" width="1340" height="102" alt="hash2"><br/></p><p></p><p>Or to binary:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_8.55.16_AM.original.png" width="1296" height="182" alt="hash binary"><br/></p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a SHA-256 hash of the sentence <i>This, is a sentence</i> produces this hexadecimal number:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_9.08.15_AM.original.png" width="1252" height="48" alt="hash3"><br/></p><p></p><p>As you can see, merely inserting one comma into the sentence completely changes the hash. And, importantly, what the hash of either sentence would be was completely unpredictable; even after the first sentence was hashed, there was no way to calculate the second hash from it. The only way to find out was to actually hash both sentences.</p><p>Hashcash applies this mathematical trick in a clever way.</p><p>With Hashcash, the metadata of an email (the “from” address, the “to” address, the time, etc.) is formalized as a protocol. Additionally, the sender of an email must add a random number to this metadata: a “nonce.” All this metadata, including the nonce, is then hashed, so the resulting hash looks a bit like one of the random numbers above.</p><p>Here’s the trick: not every hash is considered “valid.” Instead, the binary version of the hash must start with a predetermined number of zeroes. For example: 20 zeroes. The sender can generate a hash that starts with 20 zeroes by including a nonce that randomly adds up correctly … but the sender can’t know in advance what that nonce will look like.</p><p>To generate a valid hash, therefore, the sender has only one option: trial and error (“brute force”). He must keep trying different nonces until he finds a valid combination; otherwise, his email will be rejected by the intended recipient’s email client. Like Dwork and Naor’s solution, this requires computational resources: it’s a proof-of-work system.</p><p>“[I]f it hasn’t got a 20 bit hash […] you have a program which bounces it with a notice explaining the required postage, and where to obtain software from,” Back explained on the Cypherpunks mailing list. “This would put spammers out of business overnight, as 1,000,000 x 20 = 100 MIP years which is going to be more compute than they\'ve got.”</p><p>Notably, Back’s proof-of-work system is more random than Dwork and Naor’s. The duo’s solution required solving a puzzle, meaning that a faster computer would solve it faster than a slow computer every time. But statistically, Hashcash would still allow for the slower computer to find a correct solution faster some of the time.</p><p>(By analogy, if one person runs faster than another person, the former will win a sprint between them every time. But if one person buys more lottery tickets than another person, the latter will statistically still win some of the time — just not as often.)</p><h4>Digital Scarcity</h4><p>Like Dwork and Naor’s proposal, Hashcash — which Back would elaborate on in a<a href="http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf"> white paper</a> in 2002 — never took off in a very big way. It was implemented in Apache’s open-source SpamAssassin platform, and Microsoft gave the proof-of-work idea a spin in the incompatible “email postmark” format. And Back, as well as other academics, came up with various alternative applications for the solution over the years, but most of these never gained much traction. For most potential applications, the lack of any network effect was probably too big to overcome.</p><p>Nevertheless, Dwork and Naor as well as Back (independently) did introduce something new. Where one of the most powerful features of digital products is the ease with which they can be copied, proof of work was essentially the first concept akin to virtual scarcity that didn’t rely on a central party: it tied digital data to the real-world, limited resource of computing power.</p><p>And scarcity, of course, is a prerequisite for money. Indeed, Back in particular explicitly placed Hashcash in the category of money throughout his Cypherpunks mailing list contributions and white paper, mirroring it to the only digital cash the world had seen at that point in time: DigiCash’s Ecash by Chaum.</p><p>“Hashcash may provide a stop gap measure until digicash becomes more widely used,” Back argued on the mailing list. “Hashcash is free, all you’ve got to do is burn some cycles on your PC. It is in keeping with net culture of free discourse, where the financially challenged can duke it out with millionaires, retired government officials, etc on equal terms. [And] Hashcash may provide us with a fall back method for controling [sic] spam if digicash goes sour (gets outlawed or required to escrow user identities).”</p><p>Despite the name, however, Hashcash couldn’t properly function as a full-fledged cash in itself (nor could Dwork and Naor’s proposal). Perhaps most importantly, any “received” proof of work is useless to the recipient. Unlike money, it could not be re-spent elsewhere. On top of that, as computers increased in speed every year, they could produce more and more proofs over time at lower cost: Hashcash would have been subject to (hyper)inflation.</p><p>What proof of work did offer, more than anything else, was a new basis for research in the digital-money realm. Several of the most notable digital-money proposals that followed were building on Hashcash, typically by allowing the proofs of work to be reused. (With Hal Finney’s Reusable Proof of Work — RPOW — as the most obvious example.)</p><h4>Bitcoin</h4><p>Ultimately, of course, proof of work became a cornerstone for Bitcoin, with Hashcash as one of the few citations in the Bitcoin white paper.</p><p>Yet, in Bitcoin, Hashcash (or, rather, a version of it) is utilized very differently than many would have guessed beforehand. Unlike Hashcash and other Hashcash-based proposals, the scarcity it provides is not itself used as money at all. Instead, Hashcash enables a race. Whichever miner is the first to produce a valid proof of work — a hash of a Bitcoin block — gets to decide which transactions go through. At least in theory, anyone can compete equally: much like a lottery, even small miners would statistically be the first to produce a valid proof of work every so often.</p><p>Further, once a new block is mined, confirming a set of transactions, these transactions are unlikely to be reversed. An attacker would have to prove at least as much work as required to find the block in the first place, and under normal circumstances exponentially more, for any additional block. The real-world resources that must be spent in order to cheat outweigh the potential profit that can be made by cheating, which should give recipients of Bitcoin transactions confidence that these transactions are final.</p><p>This is how, in Bitcoin, Hashcash killed two birds with one stone. It solved the <a data-original-title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spending problem</a> in a decentralized way, while providing a trick to get new coins into circulation with no centralized issuer.</p><p>Hashcash did not realize the first electronic cash system — Ecash takes that crown, and proof-of-work could not really function as money. But a <i>decentralized</i> electronic cash system might well have been impossible without Back’s proof of work.</p><p><i>For more on the history of proof of work, also see<a data-original-title="" href="http://hashcash.org"> hashcash.org</a> and, in particular,<a data-original-title="" href="http://hashcash.org/papers/"> hashcash.org/papers/</a>.</i></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>\n\n          \n\n          <p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com">Bitcoin Magazine</a>.</em></p>',

Wearing Back’s shirt while crossing the border to exit the United States technically made you a “munitions exporter.”</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/munitions_tshirt.original.jpg" width="990" height="550" alt="munitions tshirt"><br/></p><p>Like many, Back was <a href="http://datwww.mit.edu/bloom-picayune/crypto/2058">not aware</a> of Dwork and Naor’s proof-of-work proposal. But by the mid-1990s, he was thinking of similar ideas to counter spam, sometimes “out loud” on the Cypherpunks mailing list.</p><p>“A side benefit of using PGP, is that PGP encryption should add some overhead to the spammer — he can probably encrypt less messages per second than he can spam down a T3 link,” Back<a data-original-title="" href="http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1997/03/msg00631.html"> commented</a>, for example, in the context of adding more privacy to remailers; an idea somewhat similar to Dwork and Naor’s.</p><p>The Cypherpunks mailing list grew significantly in about half a decade. What started out as an online discussion platform for a group of people that initially gathered at one of their startups in the Bay Area became a small internet phenomenon with thousands of subscribers — and often more emails on a single day than anyone could reasonably keep track of.</p><p>It was around this time — 1997, close to the list’s peak popularity — that Back submitted his Hashcash proposal.</p><h4>Hashcash</h4><p>Hashcah is similar to Dwork and Naor’s anti-spam proposal and has the same purpose, though Back proposed some additional use cases like countering anonymous remailer abuse. But as the name suggests, Hashcash was not based on cryptographic puzzles like Dwork and Naor’s; it was based on hashing.</p><p>Hashing is a cryptographic trick that takes any data — whether it’s a single letter or an entire book — and turns it into a seemingly random number of predetermined length.</p>For example, a SHA-256 hash of the sentence <i>This is a sentence</i> produces this hexadecimal number:<p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_9.06.43_AM.original.png" width="1250" height="48" alt="hash1"><br/></p><p></p><p>Which can be “translated” to the regular decimal number:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_8.55.03_AM.original.png" width="1340" height="102" alt="hash2"><br/></p><p></p><p>Or to binary:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_8.55.16_AM.original.png" width="1296" height="182" alt="hash binary"><br/></p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a SHA-256 hash of the sentence <i>This, is a sentence</i> produces this hexadecimal number:</p><p><img class="richtext-image lightbox" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/Screen_Shot_2018-06-04_at_9.08.15_AM.original.png" width="1252" height="48" alt="hash3"><br/></p><p></p><p>As you can see, merely inserting one comma into the sentence completely changes the hash. And, importantly, what the hash of either sentence would be was completely unpredictable; even after the first sentence was hashed, there was no way to calculate the second hash from it. The only way to find out was to actually hash both sentences.</p><p>Hashcash applies this mathematical trick in a clever way.</p><p>With Hashcash, the metadata of an email (the “from” address, the “to” address, the time, etc.) is formalized as a protocol. Additionally, the sender of an email must add a random number to this metadata: a “nonce.” All this metadata, including the nonce, is then hashed, so the resulting hash looks a bit like one of the random numbers above.</p><p>Here’s the trick: not every hash is considered “valid.” Instead, the binary version of the hash must start with a predetermined number of zeroes. For example: 20 zeroes. The sender can generate a hash that starts with 20 zeroes by including a nonce that randomly adds up correctly … but the sender can’t know in advance what that nonce will look like.</p><p>To generate a valid hash, therefore, the sender has only one option: trial and error (“brute force”). He must keep trying different nonces until he finds a valid combination; otherwise, his email will be rejected by the intended recipient’s email client. Like Dwork and Naor’s solution, this requires computational resources: it’s a proof-of-work system.</p><p>“[I]f it hasn’t got a 20 bit hash […] you have a program which bounces it with a notice explaining the required postage, and where to obtain software from,” Back explained on the Cypherpunks mailing list. “This would put spammers out of business overnight, as 1,000,000 x 20 = 100 MIP years which is going to be more compute than they\'ve got.”</p><p>Notably, Back’s proof-of-work system is more random than Dwork and Naor’s. The duo’s solution required solving a puzzle, meaning that a faster computer would solve it faster than a slow computer every time. But statistically, Hashcash would still allow for the slower computer to find a correct solution faster some of the time.</p><p>(By analogy, if one person runs faster than another person, the former will win a sprint between them every time. But if one person buys more lottery tickets than another person, the latter will statistically still win some of the time — just not as often.)</p><h4>Digital Scarcity</h4><p>Like Dwork and Naor’s proposal, Hashcash — which Back would elaborate on in a<a href="http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf"> white paper</a> in 2002 — never took off in a very big way. It was implemented in Apache’s open-source SpamAssassin platform, and Microsoft gave the proof-of-work idea a spin in the incompatible “email postmark” format. And Back, as well as other academics, came up with various alternative applications for the solution over the years, but most of these never gained much traction. For most potential applications, the lack of any network effect was probably too big to overcome.</p><p>Nevertheless, Dwork and Naor as well as Back (independently) did introduce something new. Where one of the most powerful features of digital products is the ease with which they can be copied, proof of work was essentially the first concept akin to virtual scarcity that didn’t rely on a central party: it tied digital data to the real-world, limited resource of computing power.</p><p>And scarcity, of course, is a prerequisite for money. Indeed, Back in particular explicitly placed Hashcash in the category of money throughout his Cypherpunks mailing list contributions and white paper, mirroring it to the only digital cash the world had seen at that point in time: DigiCash’s Ecash by Chaum.</p><p>“Hashcash may provide a stop gap measure until digicash becomes more widely used,” Back argued on the mailing list. “Hashcash is free, all you’ve got to do is burn some cycles on your PC. It is in keeping with net culture of free discourse, where the financially challenged can duke it out with millionaires, retired government officials, etc on equal terms. [And] Hashcash may provide us with a fall back method for controling [sic] spam if digicash goes sour (gets outlawed or required to escrow user identities).”</p><p>Despite the name, however, Hashcash couldn’t properly function as a full-fledged cash in itself (nor could Dwork and Naor’s proposal). Perhaps most importantly, any “received” proof of work is useless to the recipient. Unlike money, it could not be re-spent elsewhere. On top of that, as computers increased in speed every year, they could produce more and more proofs over time at lower cost: Hashcash would have been subject to (hyper)inflation.</p><p>What proof of work did offer, more than anything else, was a new basis for research in the digital-money realm. Several of the most notable digital-money proposals that followed were building on Hashcash, typically by allowing the proofs of work to be reused. (With Hal Finney’s Reusable Proof of Work — RPOW — as the most obvious example.)</p><h4>Bitcoin</h4><p>Ultimately, of course, proof of work became a cornerstone for Bitcoin, with Hashcash as one of the few citations in the Bitcoin white paper.</p><p>Yet, in Bitcoin, Hashcash (or, rather, a version of it) is utilized very differently than many would have guessed beforehand. Unlike Hashcash and other Hashcash-based proposals, the scarcity it provides is not itself used as money at all. Instead, Hashcash enables a race. Whichever miner is the first to produce a valid proof of work — a hash of a Bitcoin block — gets to decide which transactions go through. At least in theory, anyone can compete equally: much like a lottery, even small miners would statistically be the first to produce a valid proof of work every so often.</p><p>Further, once a new block is mined, confirming a set of transactions, these transactions are unlikely to be reversed. An attacker would have to prove at least as much work as required to find the block in the first place, and under normal circumstances exponentially more, for any additional block. The real-world resources that must be spent in order to cheat outweigh the potential profit that can be made by cheating, which should give recipients of Bitcoin transactions confidence that these transactions are final.</p><p>This is how, in Bitcoin, Hashcash killed two birds with one stone. It solved the <a data-original-title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spending problem</a> in a decentralized way, while providing a trick to get new coins into circulation with no centralized issuer.</p><p>Hashcash did not realize the first electronic cash system — Ecash takes that crown, and proof-of-work could not really function as money. But a <i>decentralized</i> electronic cash system might well have been impossible without Back’s proof of work.</p><p><i>For more on the history of proof of work, also see<a data-original-title="" href="http://hashcash.org"> hashcash.org</a> and, in particular,<a data-original-title="" href="http://hashcash.org/papers/"> hashcash.org/papers/</a>.</i></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>\n\n          \n\n           <p><em>This  article originally appeared on <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com">Bitcoin Magazine</a>.</em></p>',

        title: 'TRON Coin Goes Red: Hype & Security Issues Negatively Affecting Tron?',
        content: '<div class="optinengine_before_post"></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new network reaching to around 2000 transactions per second, <strong>Tron coin</strong> (TRX) is all set for an exhilarating journey towards the top. But this clearly lies in counteractive viewpoint to come to light as what the markets observed after its mainnet’s launch, is a sharp decline in the crypto’s trade.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tron’s current value amounts to USD $0.059 experiencing a 4.1% dip in the trends. To sustain its future credibility, Tron regulators have decided to host coordinated hackathons to guarantee the MainNet’s security.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Tron coin mainnet launch did not live upto the expectations</strong></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When authorities rolled out the <a href="https://coingape.com/tron-mainnet-launch-trx-price-rise/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mainnet</a>, setting Tron coin apart from the <strong>ERC20</strong> <strong>tokens</strong>, the surges and hiking trends were expected out of this endeavor. But it turned out to be a reversed scenario where marking a sharp downfall of 74% since the all-time high, Tron is under great upheaval.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks that the idea of technology expansion that made Tron leave the Ethereum block previously did not sync with the endeavors that it aspired to fulfill. Rather, it ended up in a worst case scenario where it is in turns right now and struggling for its stability.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems to be a bug that is responsible for the ongoing nuisance. Despite the team’s adamancy for its network being bug-free, they have rolled out a bug bounty program guaranteeing the reporter $10 million as a reward.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Also, read: <a title="The EOS Mainnet Launch: Shall we deem it a success? Not yet." href="https://coingape.com/eos-coin-mainnet-launch-shall-deem-success/?utm_source=read_more&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="bookmark">The EOS Mainnet Launch: Shall we deem it a success? Not yet.</a></strong></span></em></p>\n<h3><strong>Seeking for collabs and agreements</strong></h3>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, to ensure the mainnet’s security, it seems that regulators are awaiting for mergers and seeking out for <a href="https://coingape.com/tron-coin-partnership-with-vsport-and-apple-stock-listing/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreements</a>. In the wake of this, hackathons can really prove to be of great help.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this September is awaited to witness a <strong>Tron hackathon</strong>, that can be significant enough to unmask the hidden prospects that Tron is undermined of. Various esteemed businesspersons, analysts, investors, exchanges and crypto enthusiasts have a keen eye on the event. Undoubtedly, this interest driven event is set to await, coming opportunities for Tron.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tron is introduced in the Indonesian <a href="https://coingape.com/us-crypto-exchange-bittrex-allows-buy-cryptos/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a>. With others, Tron is now live listed on 98 exchanges around the globe. This is yet another step in regards to its forward leap, so planned.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In wake of the popularity of Tron coin among investors, the surge is yet to come in short span of time. And the cryptocurrency will be up for yet another stark comeback that will soon roll out by the end of June, as suggested by the analysts and business enthusiasts.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the efforts and consolidatory position that the team abides by is yet to witness a positive response soon in real time.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you expect out the trend to be? Will it be rising, or on the contrary, continue to decline in sync with present time situation?</strong> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class="optinengine_after_post"></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coingape.com/tron-coin-goes-red-hype-affecting-tron/">TRON Coin Goes Red: Hype &#038; Security Issues Negatively Affecting Tron?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coingape.com">Coingape</a>.</p>',

It will expose the education community to many a number of use cases in the blockchain industry that can heighten research within the space.</p>\n<p>Owing to Ripple’s outstanding performance in the blockchain world, it is no doubt that it can perform excellently in the academic community and create nonexistent ideas in this space, the same manner it is doing in the fintech world.</p>\n<p>In so doing, Ripple has dedicated more than <strong>$50 million in funding</strong>, expertise and technical resources to UBRI’s maiden partners, which includes 17 internationally recognized institutions around the world.</p>\n<p>Among the first batch of partners is the <a href="https://www.unic.ac.cy/">University of Nicosia, Cyprus</a>, one of the frontrunner in blockchain education in the world. Also, it involves the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">The University of Pennsylvania</a> where UBRI is financing selected MBA-MS candidates yearly in a newly established Wharton-Engineering dual-degree program. The support will give students working on blockchain or cryptocurrency a top regard.</p>\n<p>In the same line, the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP), <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a> is saddled with the responsibility of creating an UBRI program that will research on the policy impact of cryptocurrencies and blockchain in the whole world.</p>\n<p>While the schools involved in UBRI will individually design their research topics and other necessary things, Ripple will finance the research and technical development to increase societal understanding of blockchain.</p>\n<p>Importantly, UBRI has linked Ripple with MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab’s new FinTech initiative that comprises close to a dozen respected companies in the financial services industry. With Ripple, they will be working with groups of CSAIL’s 116+ researchers on topics revolving around blockchain, cryptocurrencies, cybersecurity and global payments.</p>\n<p><strong>UBRI’s complete list of partners as </strong><a href="https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-introduces-the-university-blockchain-research-initiative/"><strong>published by Ripple</strong></a><strong> today:</strong></p>\n<p><a href="https://law.anu.edu.au/">Australian National University College of the Law</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.princeton.edu">CITP at Princeton</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL at MIT</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology (Netherlands)</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://portal.fgv.br/">Fundação Getulio Vargas (Brazil)</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.berkeley.edu">Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H)</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.korea.edu/">Korea University</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.utexas.edu">McCombs School of Business, UT-Austin</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.unc.edu">The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">The University of Pennsylvania</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL (University College London)</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://wwwen.uni.lu/">University of Luxembourg</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.unic.ac.cy">University of Nicosia (Cyprus)</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/ripple-xrp-enters-edtech-with-university-blockchain-research-initiative-around-20-top-univ-involved/">Ripple (XRP) Enters EdTech With University Blockchain Research Initiative, Around 20 Top Univ.

It will also serve as a marketplace where consumers and distributors can purchase or rent this original premium content. Built on the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum blockchain</a>, the platform uses virtual tokens to securely record every project&rsquo;s progress and guarantee that every team member has a stake in the project. Qravity then distributes profits derived from finished content among its creators and project founder according to their respective stakes.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The company&rsquo;s founder and CEO, David Brandstaetter, explained to Cointelegraph: &ldquo;Qravity tracks tasks in such a way that creative members receive stakes in the content they help make. For example, a person who writes lyrics for a song gets a share, say five percent, of the song&rsquo;s revenue. Every time someone buys that song, the lyricist gets five percent of that payment.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Content creators receive an immutable and transparent record of their project stakes in the form of a digital token known as QPT, an asset which is used internally within the ecosystem and cannot be purchased on crypto exchanges. Project founders allocate fixed amounts of QPT to tasks according to their own criteria, such as task complexity or the estimated time required for a task to be completed. Founders can also set the amount of QPT they themselves receive upon project completion.</p>\n\n<p>Qravity&rsquo;s cryptocurrency is called QCO; within its ecosystem, individuals and distributors can use it to license or purchase content directly. Royalties from these sales are then distributed according to each project member&rsquo;s QPT holdings.</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Helping content creators make a living</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">To emphasise one of the benefits of its platform, <a  href="https://qravity.com/en/" rel="nofollow,noopener"  rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Qravity</a> highlights the case of the 19th-century poet and author Edgar Allan Poe. His poem The Raven received critical acclaim in 1845 and is still internationally renowned and celebrated to this day. Despite this, he only earned $24 for his literary masterpiece &ndash; the equivalent of $754.91 when adjusted for inflation in 2018.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Mr Poe&rsquo;s earnings during his 20-year literary career would be worth a total of just $195,018 today. This in part motivated Mr. Brandstaetter, an Austrian composer and producer, to help today&rsquo;s creatives overcome the challenges that all too often deny them the chance to earn a living &ndash; hurdles such as unfair payment and copyright infringement.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Mr. Brandstaetter told Cointelegraph: &ldquo;I was speaking with my friend and business partner Sascha Dennstedt [Qravity&rsquo;s co-founder and CFO] about Poe and how, in some ways, little has changed financially for artists. He said that we should integrate blockchain into Qravity. Some research convinced me that this made perfect sense.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Project already in the pipeline</h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Qravity says it plans to only host commercially viable content, reviewing all proposals for new projects carefully to ensure that stakeholders stand to make the highest possible profit.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The company completed is MVP in July 2017; later that year, Mr. Brandstaetter and his team began planning for blockchain integration.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Qravity&rsquo;s fast-approaching presale will offer a 30 percent bonus for early contributors. It is splitting its token sale into five rounds, with the first phase commencing two weeks after the presale&rsquo;s launch.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Production of Qravity&rsquo;s pilot project, a 3D animated feature film called Lizzard Maddoxx, will start in September 2018, with the company planning to release, distribute, and monetize the movie in September 2019. It will begin accepting proposals for new content in January 2019, after it updates the platform according to beta testing results.</p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div id="post-content">\n<p><span style="font-size: 12px; color: rgb(169, 169, 169);"><span style="font-weight: 600">Disclaimer.</span> Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

The event-ticketing platform is still trying to recover from the “cyber incident.” “We&#8217;re working to bring ticketfly.com back up as soon as possible,” its team said, notifying users that the site is offline.</p>\n<p>In correspondence with <em>Motherboard</em>, the supposed hacker claimed to have warned Ticketfly of a vulnerability that allowed him to take control of its database and website. The hijacker asked for 1 bitcoin (BTC) to explain the issue in details but did not receive a reply. According to the publication, after no ransom was paid, the attacker posted the user data online.</p>\n<p>“We have learned that some customer information has been compromised as part of the incident, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers of Ticketfly fans,” the company admitted without revealing how many accounts have been affected. According the data breach tracking website haveibeenpwned.com, more than 26 million accounts have been compromised, <em>Marketwatch</em> reports.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-170222 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ticketfly-site.jpg" alt="Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Zencash Targeted in 51% Attack, Ticketfly Hijacked for Ransom" width="1000" height="300" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ticketfly-site.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ticketfly-site-300x90.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ticketfly-site-768x230.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ticketfly-site-696x209.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>\n<p>It’s unclear whether any event tickets have been stolen but a number of promoters, clubs and upcoming shows have been affected by the breach.

According to a press release, the two sides have not been able to reach a consensus in regards to the holding, conversion, trading, and arbitrage of the acquired digital currencies.</p>\n<p>World Mahjong Limited, a provider of online games and entertainment services, decided to enter the crypto sector through the acquisition of crypto mining abilities and cryptocurrency assets from the mining and community knowledge network Avalon Life SA and Avalon Projects Canada Inc. More than 27,000 ASIC mining machines were purchased, along with a number of Dash, Vivo, and Pura coins.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-170227 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_774939070.jpg" alt="Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Zencash Targeted in 51% Attack, Ticketfly Hijacked for Ransom" width="1000" height="550" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_774939070.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_774939070-300x165.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_774939070-768x422.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_774939070-696x383.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_774939070-764x420.jpg 764w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>\n<p>Earlier this year it was reported that the company had also changed its name to Avalon Blockchain. In its latest statement, however, it said it was unable to execute its proposed business plan involving these crypto assets. Following the agreement with the vendor, Avalon Blockchain will return them to Avalon Life SA and will arrange the cancellation of 120,000,000 common shares that have been issued.</p>\n<p>Avalon Projects Canada Inc., a subsidiary of Avalon Blockchain, has completed the offering of 37,154,502 subscription receipts, at a price of $0.50 each. The company now intends to allow subscribers to rescind their subscriptions. All of them will be offered the option and will be entitled to a full refund of all subscription proceeds tendered to the company.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

The event-ticketing platform is still trying to recover from the &ldquo;cyber incident.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working to bring ticketfly.com back up as soon as possible,&rdquo; its team said, notifying users that the site is offline.</p>\n<p>In correspondence with <em>Motherboard</em>, the supposed hacker claimed to have warned Ticketfly of a vulnerability that allowed him to take control of its database and website. The hijacker asked for 1 bitcoin (BTC) to explain the issue in details but did not receive a reply. According to the publication, after no ransom was paid, the attacker posted the user data online.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have learned that some customer information has been compromised as part of the incident, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers of Ticketfly fans,&rdquo; the company admitted without revealing how many accounts have been affected.

        content: '<p>Tron Main Net was launched successfully on the 31st of May and the news is still fresh across the globe. The main net launch ushered a whole new chapter to the Tron community as they crossed a milestone and the most awaited one.</p>\n<p>They are now approaching the token migration which is expected to happen on June 25th. Tron will depart from the Ethereum network and ERC-20 tokens to enter a new network. Their blockchain protocol is the biggest in the world and the technology promises to revolutionize the entire crypto world and support the strong vision of making Tron [TRX] the world&rsquo;s best currency. Post token swap, Tron will proudly flaunt its TRC-20 coin as they are ready to set a standard for themselves and the entire community.</p>\n<p>With more than 20 exchanges including the top and most popular ones supporting this migration act, users are bound to have a seamless shift to experience a whole new payment system. Additionally, Tron&rsquo;s project genesis is seemingly a huge part of Tron&rsquo;s growth with the network.</p>\n<p>Along with the support from various exchanges for a smooth transition of tokens, a lot of exchanges from around the world are coming forward to list TRX on their platform. The founder had also recently assured a lot more to be expected soon as they are slowly expanding over the boundaries and beyond their region. Malta and Indonesia are the biggest and the latest expansion schemes from Tron, looked up to from both ends.</p>\n<p>The next thing to look up to is the SR election that probably no other blockchain or coin has hosted so far. They have witnessed around 60 candidates coming forward to participate. They will choose 27 final representatives who will stand by Tron throughout its journey. The election process provides an experience for all the candidates of a truly democratic election process.</p>\n<p>These elected block producers will be responsible for maintaining Tron&rsquo;s network governance. The spread of candidates includes individuals and companies from various sectors like exchange platforms, mining pools, funds, community supporters, and developers. Hello World and Infinity Stones are the latest to join the list of candidates.</p>\n<p>The website has also been revamped to allow easy access to &ldquo;state of Tron DApps&rdquo;, a user-friendly layout running on Tron&rsquo;s protocol. Additional features like the Tron block explorer allows users to browse blockchains, node map, SR search, voting, and TRX market info along with support for address, block height, token id, and the token itself.</p>\n<p>This is all just the beginning, the main picture is still in the frame as they have a lot more exciting things to offer to the entire audience that includes developers, users, traders, and supporters.</p>\n<p>In a post, Justin Sun, the founder mentioned:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With constant growth of our team, contributions from the community developers and accomplishing each step in the roadmap, the expansion of the TRON ecosystem will continue to grow each day.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Adding on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With the support and effort by everyone to create and launch a successful main net, we are excited to bring both the community, and the world, so many new and innovative ways to use blockchain technology.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com/tron-trxs-timeline-flashback-and-post-main-net-improvements/">Tron [TRX]&#8217;s timeline flashback and post main net improvements</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com">AMBCrypto</a>.</p>',

It doesn&rsquo;t explain much though.</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6K0xQgaCAg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>\n<p>IOTA&nbsp;was launched in 2015.&nbsp;It is one of the more valuable cryptocurrencies out there, with a market capitalisation of $4.8 billion according to <em>coinmarketcap.com</em>. At one point it even surpassed Ripple, although that particular spike in price was at least partly due to a misunderstanding regarding the company&rsquo;s relationship with Microsoft.</p>\n<p>It is a cryptocurrency designed to be faster than Bitcoin by using a unique kind of network which it calls &lsquo;the Tangle&rsquo;. It works quickly because a new block of data is added automatically with every transaction, and these transactions can take place off-chain to be added later. Mining/verification is conducted by small groups of users who have been delegated the task.</p>\n<p>IOTA has higher aims than being a cryptocurrency though &ndash; it wants to create an &lsquo;internet-of-things&rsquo;. This is a concept where all devices are connected and controlled by the internet. To this end, IOTA has been developing a mysterious protocol called Qubic.</p>\n<h2><strong>Qubic</strong></h2>\n<p>The word Qubic comes from the acronym for &lsquo;quorum-based-computing&rsquo;. A quorom is the minimum number of participants necessary to make the proceedings of a given meeting valid, which is a principle that can also apply to distributed ledger technology.</p>\n<p>According to the official&nbsp; website, Qubic (big Q) is a protocol which will connect the world to the Tangle. Specific operations that take place within the protocol are called qubics. Qubics (small q) can do many things but they all work on the same principle.</p>\n<p>They work through what IOTA calls an &lsquo;oracle machines&rsquo;, which read and transmit data from the real world. This could mean election results, a human being&rsquo;s personal attributes, the weather. The qubics process that information, their main purpose being to ensure its consistency and reliability via consensus.</p>\n<p>IOTA considers users to be one type of oracle machine (&ldquo;the external actors such as users, or machines that provide sensor data&rdquo;). So for those that enjoy fancy job titles, you may not be able to surpass what IOTA offers here.</p>\n<p>The Qubic protocol also allows people to outsource computing, which means that devices can ask other devices to compute for them. One assigns a task to an available machine using a qubic programme, which will relay your instructions and the returning results while ensuring &ldquo;that the results can be trusted to a high degree of certainty.&rdquo; Users can also offer their computing power to others.</p>\n<p>At this point it should be noted that Qubic is not a currency. There will be no ICO, and no tokens to buy. IOTA has not yet specified what the incentive would be to offer computing power.</p>\n<p>Smart contracts are also a big part of the Qubic system. Introduced to the public by Ethereum, smart contracts are computer-based contracts which are popular because they are inherently free and fair, eliminating as they do the need for an unreliable human as a third party.</p>\n<p>According to IOTA, Qubic will take these one step further: &ldquo;While Qubic is of course capable of supporting these kinds of traditional smart contracts, the combination of fee-free transactions together with general-purpose quorum-based computation opens the door to entirely new possibilities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>These possibilities involve the internet-of-things. An oracle such as yourself could report weather data to the Tangle. The qubits take the data from users, make an average and publish it in the network. &ldquo;The smart contract has now become an oracle in and of itself &ndash; that is, the contract itself has become a source of external data.&rdquo; This describes a kind of chain of information reliance. Another example would be exchange rate gathering, leading to market movement prediction, leading to portfolio management decisions.</p>\n<div class="bs-shortcode bs-text ">\n<div class="bs-text-content">\n<p>IOTA says that Qubic &ldquo;will be a platform for the greater community and ecosystem to create things we can&rsquo;t even imagine yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has been working on it for &ldquo;quite a while internally&rdquo; and will be giving it priority over the next two years..</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/iota-releases-details-major-project-qubic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IOTA Releases Details of Major Project, Qubic</a> was originally published on <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.financemagnates.com/</a>.

The exchange has exclusively made the XRP/JPY trading pair available while plans are in for BTC and BCH as well. One of the few cryptos in the green, with these developments, XRP is slowing inching its way to $1. </span></p>\n<h2><b>SBI Holdings officially launches bank-backed crypto exchange </b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese financial giant <strong>SBI Holdings</strong> has finally announced that its cryptocurrency exchange is now live. After months of delay, the platform called <strong>VCTRADE</strong> is finally here. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an official </span><a href="https://www.sbivc.co.jp/topics/pdf/20180604_release.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company clarifies that the service is initially open for users that previously registered on the platform which is for about 20,000 people. However, it will make its services available to a wider audience from next month i.e. July. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SBI </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/news/altcoin-news/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual Currencies</a> is the wholly owned subsidiary of SBI Holdings which marks the first cryptocurrency exchange of the country that is backed by a major financial institution. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, in September, the platform completed its registration with the Financial Services Agency (FSA).  However, amidst the Coincheck hack, the launch got delayed due to security concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We offer the lowest-delay trading environment of the world highest level using Tem (matching engine)”, reads the official announcement. Offering a free transaction fee, the exchange does apply a withdrawal fee that will be charged at the time of withdrawal.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Also, read: <a title="3 Latest Reasons Ripple [XRP] Demands Attention" href="https://coingape.com/reasons-ripple-coin-xrp-demands-attention/?utm_source=read_more&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="bookmark">3 Latest Reasons<span class="highlighted"> Ripple</span> [XRP] Demands Attention</a></strong></span></em></p>\n<h3><b>XRP focused trading, making its way to $1 </b></h3>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the first step in this direction, the exchange would focus on the trading of XRP. The official website has already provided information on the <strong>XRP</strong> which is the only cryptocurrency supported by the exchange right one. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is no surprise as the news has been doing the rounds for a long time. Also, given the fact that SBI Holdings is already working with Ripple technology for cross-border transactions, this was expected.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exchange will further add support for <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-down-gear-up-for-bull-rally/?utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin </a>(BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

XRP is gaining a lot of attention and adoption, which is a significant factor in its long-term success. </span></p>\n<p><strong>What your views on SBI’s virtual currency exchange?

Some were even stranded in traffic as they were unable to pay for their toll using their cards.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">One VISA customer by the name of Adam had this to say to the BBC about the whole experience:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style="text-align: justify">We have spent all day boating to moor up at a riverside pub in Kidlington for a birthday meal only to find the visa payments are not working. Having only £20 between us we have had to opt for a birthday drink instead. [There is] no cash point for miles around and no car as we are on the canal boat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style="text-align: justify">In Glasgow, another VISA customer, Deborah Eldar, had this to say when interviewed by the BBC:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style="text-align: justify">I was so embarrassed. I gave the waiter the 14 euros I had left. I&#8217;m worried I won&#8217;t be able to get home when I land in Toulouse as I have no cash for a taxi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style="text-align: justify">VISA would later confirm that services were back to normal and gave the explanation of hardware failure as earlier mentioned.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">Such an outage has led many crypto enthusiast and believers <a href="https://www.ccn.com/op-ed-visa-vs-cryptocurrency-its-only-a-matter-of-time/">to reinforce their long held views</a> that the time is nigh for cryptocurrencies to replace all other forms of traditional payment. The decentralized background of the crypto-verse does not depend on the centralized systems seen in the described VISA incident.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">VISA runs on a select group of private servers that can leave the network crippled if they are affected by a malicious hack or hardware failure. Such servers usually have redundancy systems but sometimes, getting them to handle the network traffic after a failure, takes some time. Time that leaves many users stranded as is the case with the VISA outage described.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">With decentralized systems, the nodes of the network are all over the globe. If the hardware at one location were to crash, the network would divert the transactions to another node. The only issue with blockchain technology is network congestion since the network can only handle a limited number of transactions per second. This becomes a problem as has been seen numerous times on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">However, with talks of scaling by the <a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/here-is-how-trons-trx-mainnet-will-be-better-than-ethereums-platform/">Tron (TRX)</a> foundation as well as <a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/what-exactly-is-zilliqa-zil/">Zilliqa (ZIL)</a> team and Ethereum (ETH) Foundation, delayed transactions will be a thing of the past.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">In conclusion, the VISA network issue caused a lot of panic in Europe that could have been avoided if the payment stations had integrated cryptocurrency payment options.</p>\n<h6 style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Disclaimer: This article is not meant to give financial advice.

The quest to become a leader in Gartner&rsquo;s Magic Quadrant would lead us to become a founding member of the MIT Auto-ID Center, where Kevin Ashton invented the term &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo;. It also lead us to collaborate with the brilliant minds of BiosGroup, a spin-off of the Santa Fe Institute and founded by the godfather of complexity science, Stuart Kauffman. The meeting Albrecht Diener (SVP of GBU Supply Chain Management) and I had with Steve David and his supply chain visionaries including Jake Barr and Franz Dill was a pivotal moment in my professional life.</p>\n<p>Not unlike blockchain technologies today, supply chain optimization was still a nascent field that held great promise, but struggled with technology limitations and organizational roadblocks. At a time when companies still struggled to implement centralized supply chain planning systems in their 4 walls, we no longer viewed supply chains as static, linear chains, but as dynamic, multi-entity networks that would need to become increasingly open and responsive to external data feeds and real-time events, be it from business partners or emerging sensor networks. Our vision was to blur the lines between the physical world and the world of computer systems using sensor technologies and software agents to create what we called &ldquo;Real-World Aware Adaptive Supply Networks&rdquo;. The system we envisioned would need to be inherently event-driven and able to interprete and process the massive amounts of data generated by sensor networks in a decentralized fashion without human intervention. Could distributed intelligence provide an answer to realizing constantly evolving, &ldquo;adaptive&rdquo; supply networks that could make predictions and coordinate local decisions with adjacent nodes? What might we learn from swarm intelligence and self-organizing principles employed by ant colonies, bee hives or flocks of birds? Where existing supply chain optimization systems were centralized and created brittle plans unable to respond to real-world events, we envisioned a distributed network of self-interested parties, based on autonomous multi-agent systems.</p>\n<p>However, we struggled with the question of what the underlying infrastructure of such an inherently distributed computing network might be. How would we manage state across a distributed system? How would we manage identities in what was supposed to be an open network and create trust? Who would carry the cost of hardware in such a shared infrastructure? How could we trust the results of local computations and distributed decisions? How would we manage the life-cycle of distributed, multi-agent systems?</p>\n<p>When I first learned about blockchains and the Ethereum platform back in 2015, I was excited about its potential. At the same time, I understood blockchain architectures&rsquo; inherent scalability limitations and transaction fees as obstacles to real world adoption. I also new that the energy intensive mining and consensus mechanism of traditional blockchains would not be a good fit with low cost IoT devices and intermittent networks.</p>\n<p>When IOTA introduced the first next generation blockchainless approach to distributed ledgers built specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT) and the machine-to-machine (M2M) economy, I was excited about its potential to bring virtually unlimited scalability and fee-less micro-transactions to the world. However, important building blocks such as smart contracts were missing.</p>\n<p><strong>Enter Qubic</strong></p>\n<p>Qubic introduces not only oracles and smart contracts, but quorum-based computations, a form of distributed computing. It essentially makes the IOTA Tangle programmable and leverages the data transfer protocol and peer-to-peer fee-less micro transactions to create incentives for outsourced computations using zero-fee micro-transactions. In the future, Qubic will leverage the world-wide available, unused computation capacity to solve all kinds of computational problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Oracles</strong></p>\n<p>In our pursuit of demand driven supply networks, we asked ourselves how weather conditions or events might impact demand in local stores? How could we factor in local conditions in demand predictions and supply decisions? IOTA and qubic introduce Oracles, that serve as trusted sources of distributed data external to the IOTA Tangle that provide the input for quorum-based computational tasks. Examples of such external data could be temperature and air quality data, exchange rates or share prices, or personal attributed such as age, martial status or brand preferences.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></p>\n<p>Oracles may also feed smart contracts. It is expected that in the future smart contracts largely replace real-world paper contracts and drive process automation by eliminating the need for third party enforcement and validation. Smart contracts could not only model contracts in a distributed network and trigger transfer of ownership and associated payments, but could also model incentive structures and business policies. However, the distributed computing model and outsourced computations of Qubic open up entirely new possibilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Qubics</strong></p>\n<p>Individual cubics are in essence pre-packaged quorum-based computational tasks.The Qubic protocol specifies the construction, execution, and evolutionary life-cycle of Qubics. It leverages the IOTA protocol for secure, trusted data transfer between the various participants in an open, distributed network. IOTA also has its own built-in payment system. where the IOTA tokens are used to pay for computational resources and provide an incentive system for Qubic operators.</p>\n<p>Just like we envisioned more than 15 years ago, Qubics are event-driven. They &lsquo;listen&rsquo; to new data and transactions on the IOTA tangle and get triggered whenever the input data changes. One Qubic can trigger a resulting cubic to execute based on its output. Essentially, Qubic enables a distributed computing model and distributed artificial intelligence that would run based on the trusted, validated and immutable data on the IOTA Tangle. A range of computing devices can form assemblies that cluster a range of computational resources around a given task. A novel, function-based programming language called ABRA will enable Qubics to run on virtually any hardware to make use of an almost limitless pool of generic computational resources. Variety of consensus mechanism can used to establish trust in data and computational results.</p>\n<p>Qubic is another important milestone in the evolution of the IOTA tangle, the world&rsquo;s first distributed ledger based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that promises to address the existing limitations of blockchain architectures around scalability, transaction fees and energy consumption. In essence, Qubic makes the IOTA Tangle programmable and introduces a distributed computing environment where machines can establish trust, share data and pay each other for any resource using fee-less micro-transactions.</p>\n<p>As somebody who prefers holistic thinking over details orientation, I am truly impressed by the vision of the IOTA founders. The Qubic vision is a major steps towards making IOTA a complete platform. With Qubic, a range of pieces that in themselves have been impressive solutions to real-world limitations of blockchain technologies come together to form a holistic platform for distributed computing, distributed artificial intelligence and swarm intelligence, leveraging a rich set of trusted, immutable and shared data stored in the IOTA Tangle.</p>\n<p>Given my background in Supply Chain Management and Industrial IoT, I am still interested in the space. After all, our work at SAP on &ldquo;Real-world Aware Adaptive Supply Networks&rdquo; had a lasting impact on me. But I am already exploring the implications of qubic on my new passion&hellip; stay tuned for my thoughts on how qubic will power the future of connected, autonomous, shared and electric mobility. In the meantime, I wish my SAP friends, customers and partners a great Sapphire 2018!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/iota-qubic-start-new-era-fulfillment-long-time-dream-alexander-renz/?published=t">IOTA and Qubic &ndash; The Start of New Era (and the Fulfillment of a Long Time Dream)</a><span> was originally published on </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">linkedin.com</a><span>.The IOTA-News Community curates, examines, and summarizes news from external services while producing its own original material.

        content: '<p>Strategic Business Innovator Group (SBI), Japanese financial giant, announced that its in-house cryptocurrency exchange is now live,  after a long delay caused by safety concerns. SBI has launched its VCTRADE service which will focus on the trading of XRP, the indigenous token derived from the Ripple protocol, and the trade will sequentially add supports for bitcoin and bitcoin cash.</p>\n<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sbigroup.co.jp/english/" rel="nofollow">SBI Group</a> is s a financial services company group based in Tokyo, Japan. SBI Group began in 1999 as SoftBank Investment, as a Softbank subsidiary at that time. SBI is listed on the first section of the Osaka Securities Exchange and Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s major business is placed as the “Financial Service Business,” which provides financial products and related services mainly based on securities, banking, insurance and housing loans; the “Asset Management Business,” which invests in Japanese and overseas venture companies in the fields of IT, biotechnology, environment/energy and finance; and the “Biotechnology-related Business,” which develops cosmetics, health foods and drug discovery globally.</p>\n<p>In October 2017, SBI Holdings announced launching its wholly-owned subsidiary &#8211; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbivc.co.jp/" rel="nofollow">SBI Virtual Currencies</a> &#8211; in order to provide the first cryptocurrency exchange that had the full support of a major financial institution.</p>\n<p>However, SBI Virtual Currencies&#8217; registration with Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency (FSA) was completed only in the end of September 2017. In a month, the company <a target="_blank" href="https://coinspeaker.com/2017/10/27/wirex-partners-sbi-holdings-launch-bitcoin-card-japan/" rel="nofollow">partnered</a> with London crypto-payments company Wirex. The aim of the partnership was to provide Japanese customers with bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment cards.</p>\n<p>In February of this year SBI announced that the opening would be delayed because of security concerns amid the Coincheck hack in late January. Moreover, the new service comes after SBI Virtual Currencies has canceled a partnership in March with crypto exchange Huobi that would use the latter&#8217;s financial and technological resources to launch VCTRADE.</p>\n<p>According to the<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbivc.co.jp/topics/pdf/20180604_release.pdf" rel="nofollow"> press release</a>, VCTRADE is currently only open for about 20,000 users who have pre-registered with the platform in October 2017. The company expects the service to be accessible for a larger public in July of this year.</p>\n<p>VCTRADE will start with the trading of Ripple’s token XRP.  Yoshitaka Kitao, President and CEO of SBI holdings, is very optimistic about this currency. He said: “XRP has a very clear use-case. It is faster, cheaper and more scalable than any other digital asset. I strongly believe it will become the global standard in digital currencies.”</p>\n<p>Later, SBI will work towards supporting bitcoin and bitcoin cash.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinspeaker.com/2018/06/04/sbi-japan-soft-launches-worlds-first-bank-backed-crypto-exchange/">SBI Japan Soft-Launches the World&#8217;s First Bank-Backed Crypto Exchange</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinspeaker.com">CoinSpeaker</a>.</p>',

        title: 'Are Bitcoin transactions instant?',
        content: '<p>While Bitcoin and other transactions have been (accurately) punted as a fast and reliable means of exchange, a common question is often whether Bitcoin transactions are as instant as (or faster than) bank transfers.</p>\n<p>The short answer to this question is no. The Bitcoin network is capable of processing a finite number of transactions per &#8216;block&#8217;, which network participants (<a href="https://www.coininsider.com/what-is-bitcoin-mining/">called miners</a>) will verify. The process of verifying a block and listing transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain can take as long as ten minutes.</p>\n<p>While this is inherently faster than the length of time a cross-border transfer may take (which can be under the jurisdiction of numerous authorities, banks, governments, or other regulators) Bitcoin transactions can be slower than bank transfers or conventional payments to a merchant or service provider.</p>\n<h3>Why do Bitcoin transactions take ten minutes?</h3>\n<p>When transacting in Bitcoin, miners receive transaction fees as profits for their labor. Typically, a transacting party may stipulate a higher fee to incentivize miners to verify their transaction ahead of all others.</p>\n<p>In the event a participant wishes to cancel a transaction, they can issue a request to the Bitcoin network with a higher transaction fee than their initial exchange &#8211; ensuring that miners are incentivized to cancel the transaction before it is processed, verified, and &#8216;confirmed&#8217;.</p>\n<p>In such instances, transacting parties may wish to see a transferred allocation of Bitcoin &#8216;confirmed&#8217; a set number of times.</p>\n<h3>What are &#8216;confirmations&#8217;?</h3>\n<p>To exemplify, let&#8217;s pretend John wishes to send one Bitcoin to Jane. Once John has issued the transaction, the transaction itself remains &#8216;unconfirmed&#8217;. Once another block has been created and another batch of transactions verified (where John&#8217;s transaction is listed), the transaction is said to be confirmed &#8216;once&#8217;.</p>\n<p>In a somewhat similar fashion to a team of human auditors verifying transactions or the exchange of funds, new &#8216;confirmations&#8217; are added after each subsequent block is added to the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>\n<p>Typically, most cryptocurrency exchanges require three confirmations before newly received funds can be used &#8211; while some investors may even require as much as 60 confirmations before they consider a transaction adequately &#8216;confirmed&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Given that new blocks are added roughly every ten minutes, it usually takes an hour to accommodate six confirmations.</p>\n<p>Many companies handling Bitcoin wallets or accepting Bitcoin as currency will require more than one confirmation before they will be willing to accept a trade as concluded. This is done so that the likelihood of a payment being reversed is mitigated.</p>\n<h3>How can I check &#8216;confirmations&#8217;?</h3>\n<p>Checking the number of confirmations on a transaction is simple. Once a party makes a transaction in Bitcoin, they are provided with a string of alphanumeric characters called a Transaction ID.</p>\n<p>Parties can examine the recorded details of their transactions on a chain analysis tool such as <a href="http://www.blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a>. When doing so, the number of confirmations processed by the Bitcoin network will be visible.</p>\n<h3>Can transactions be &#8216;lost&#8217;, or unconfirmed?</h3>\n<p>In some cases &#8211; or during peak congestion on the Bitcoin network &#8211; a transaction can &#8216;lag&#8217; and may not be processed for more than 72 hours. In some cases, delays make take even longer than that.</p>\n<p>Users in this situation have the option of issuing a request to cancel the transaction, or can re-broadcast the same transaction to incentivize a miner to process the exchange more quickly.</p>\n<h3>Will the Bitcoin network get faster?</h3>\n<p>&#8216;Scaling&#8217; &#8211; expanding the Bitcoin network to handle more transactions, and the requests of more users &#8211; is a contentious debate.</p>\n<p>Some proponents have argued that Bitcoin requires a <a href="https://www.coininsider.com/lightning-network/">&#8220;second layer&#8221; solution</a> (that is, a transactional network built atop the Bitcoin network) to handle smaller &#8216;microtransactional&#8217; payments &#8211; such as buying a cup of coffee from a barista. Through doing so, Bitcoin transactions may become faster as less stress is placed upon the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>\n<p>Other parties have argued that Bitcoin doesn&#8217;t require a second layer, and that instead the Bitcoin network needs to be able to handle more transactions per second. <a href="https://www.coininsider.com/will-bitcoin-or-bitcoin-cash-succeed/">Such parties have argued</a> that by increasing the size of blocks, more transactions can be accommodated every ten minutes.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coininsider.com/are-bitcoin-transactions-instant/">Are Bitcoin transactions instant?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coininsider.com">Coin Insider</a>.</p>',

The main goal of the project was to reward the Tron developer community by providing an avenue to participate in the development of the project with financial incentives in the form of the said rewards.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">The total funds set aside for TronPG is $2 Billion and includes the currently ongoing Tron Loan program and <a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/justin-sun-increases-tron-trx-bug-bounty-reward-to-10-million/">Bug Bounty</a> program. Also to note is that there will be <strong>a scheduled Tron Hackathon in the month of September this year</strong> to further the security efforts on the MainNet platform. Developers will test vulnerabilities in the network and the Tron foundation will <a href="https://medium.com/@Tronfoundation/mainnet-launch-livestream-5-31-recap-7e0a8ab15509">set aside millions</a> of dollars as rewards for any individual or developer teams that manage to find any.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">Also in the month of September, will be a Tron Developer&#8217;s Convention that is to be organized by the Tron foundation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">Recapping on the events on the <a href="https://tron.network/index?lng=en">Tron</a> road-map for the month of June, we find that there is the token migration that begins on the 21st of June to the 24th.

With the bug bounty program also ongoing, the MainNet is being tested for vulnerabilities with the Genesis Block scheduled for the launch on the 25th of June.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify">This means that the month of June will be an eventful month for the Tron project and token.

They have been touring around Africa with the #TransformAfrica motive in places like Ethiopia and Rwanda. The team has been updating about the progress and are moving closer to their vision.</p>\n<p>Input Output tweeted another update earlier today:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vision for #blockchain in #Africa is becoming a reality &#8211; Ethiopia and Rwanda are keen to realize the promise of the technology. Read about the recent achievements for #Cardano in Africa on the blog from @jjtoconnor, IOHK Director of African Operations.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>This long-term vision has existed longer than IOHK itself. John O&rsquo;Connor, the director of African Operations mentioned how Charles Hoskinson&rsquo;s talk about this in a TEDx event in 2014 encouraged him to join the Cardano project. He spoke about the mutual vision to make Africa a better and advanced nation.</p>\n<p>Rick McCracken, a Twitterati says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is great news Charles. You really are making the world a better place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>IOHK and the Ethiopian government agreed mutually and signed a MoU to train and hire fresh software developers as they plan to use Cardano in its agriculture industry. The actual work begins now with the use of Cardano to solve real-world problems in Ethiopia and beyond. The training course and hiring plans as agreed by Charles, the founder of IOHK, and the idea to introduce Cardano in Ethiopian agriculture is the first of its kind ever in Africa.</p>\n<p>The classes are planned to begin around September, expecting 30 women developers on the inaugural class. The trainees will then be hired based on their performance. The criteria will not only be restricted to the contribution to Cardano&rsquo;s code but also the support to build the blockchain agriculture apps. The opportunity to make an impact on blockchain is huge with more than 80 million Ethiopians working in the industry.</p>\n<p>John O&#8217;Connor expressed his gratitude stating:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I thank the IOHK and Emurgo teams who flew out to be on the ground and help us establish our work.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>He continued:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But most importantly, I&rsquo;d like to thank Yodahe Zemichael from the Science Technology and Information Centre and Dr Getahun Mekuria, Minister of Science and Technology. You have been more agile, proactive, and enthusiastic partners than we could have hoped for. We look forward to working with you.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com/cardano-ada-step-closer-transform-africa-vision-reality/">Cardano [ADA] is one step closer to turn &#8220;Transform Africa&#8221; vision into reality</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ambcrypto.com">AMBCrypto</a>.</p>',

If you host a &ldquo;Q-Node&rdquo;, a node that supports the Q protocol (layer) you can earn rewards in these manners: Offering PoW (mining rigs, computer, or your coffee pot), PoS (your IOTA&rsquo;s that you hold), your bandwidth that you don&rsquo;t use (probably something to do with LIFI in the future, so this could be your router and lightbulbs in your house), and simply, the previous history of running an honest node for the&nbsp;system.</p>\n<p>All of the above can be used to pass the &ldquo;resource test phase&rdquo;. All of those resources: PoW, PoS, Po(Bandwidth), and Po(Honesty) are measured and quantified. Your resources than essentially set you in an equivalent resource pool ie: in a pool with other people of similar resource&nbsp;power.</p>\n<p>You then earn IOTA&rsquo;s from people using the Oracle system, smart contract, or simply who want computational power (which is absolutely needed to be able to outsource the IoT industry which is for sure the&nbsp;future.</p>\n<p>So what does that&nbsp;mean.</p>\n<p>Before do you remember all of the questions: IOTA won&rsquo;t work because people won&rsquo;t run nodes, because they don&rsquo;t get incentives like traditional blockchains. Well now they can!!! And not only that, &ldquo;Q&rdquo; takes every aspect of each crypto and combines it all in&nbsp;one&hellip;</p>\n<p>PoS, PoW, PoBandwidth, and PoHonesty.</p>\n<p>More so, if you have Asic&rsquo;s, you are in the Asic&rsquo;s pool, GPU&rsquo;s, your in the GPU pool, old crappy computer (your in the old crappy computer pool), you stake a lot of IOTA, your in the high stake IOTA pool&hellip;&nbsp;etc.</p>\n<p>People will purchase &ldquo;resources&rdquo; using the Qubic protocol. If they want quality, fast, or extreme computational power they have to&nbsp;pay.</p>\n<p>Remember, you the user set what you want to receive in IOTA for your resources (economic principles). If you spend $1200 a month on electricity and equipment, you will only charge more than $1200 a month. No one would charge less. So in your pool, everyone will eventually come to a quorum charging a set amount, and thus the economy (the users) will pay for it. So in essence, the better the pool, the more the reward you get (based on economic principals in society (just like blockchain).</p>\n<p>However, if your coffee pot has a jinn chip that is Ternary hardware, with Ternary programming (ABRA), than it can sell it&rsquo;s resources when it&rsquo;s not making coffee ie:&nbsp;PoW.</p>\n<p>Also, your autonomous car not only can offer up its PoW, it can also stake the IOTA&rsquo;s it is not using in it&rsquo;s wallet, the bandwidth when it isn&rsquo;t working or driving, and the experience / honesty factor it has as a node, and even the electricity it made from it&rsquo;s solar power roof and sell it to the grid. Your car has &ldquo;multiple&rdquo; resources. The Qubic network allows machines to offer &ldquo;all&rdquo; of their resources, not just one or two like blockchain.</p>\n<p>Qubics revolutionizes machinery allowing it, the machinery, to sell it&rsquo;s resources. This is another building block to the ultimate vision of a machines acting in a &ldquo;machine economy&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Rather than us setting this up, and the fees we want to charge, eventually we can create smart contracts with Qubic functions, so the machines can negotiate and earn &ldquo;themselves&rdquo;, the machines will sell and buy resources THEMSELVES, truly creating a machine economy, &ldquo;AND&rdquo; if you own the machine, you earn the rewards (ie: income, passive&nbsp;income).</p>\n<p>Take Away&nbsp;Two:</p>\n<p>2. From the above description these are only a few use cases that I take away from reading about Qubics. The reality is that the community will be coming up with new use cases every day for the following year probably. Use cases that we can&rsquo;t even imagine, but here is my second takeaway:</p>\n<p>The Qubic protocol, where all this is happening. Miners earning, people staking their IOTA and earning (ie: &ldquo;interest&rdquo; or &ldquo;passive income&rdquo;) because they are HODLER&rsquo;s, Forex financial companies using Qubics for quorum &ldquo;ORACLE&rdquo; data, smart-contracts being run on the protocol, scientist using computational power for medical research, VW and Bosch using computational power for their IoT devices, etc. on and on. All those use cases, to power&hellip;. TO POWER, to run the network, all of those functions will be conducted with zero fee transactions that take place on the&nbsp;Tangle.</p>\n<p>The whole system runs on data transactions (zero fee transactions) by sending MetaData on the transaction which is sent on the Tangle. Meta Data essentially (I&rsquo;m not a techie) is like the language that tells the Q-Nodes to wake up, to process data, pay, earn, and receive, and essentially run the whole Q&nbsp;network.</p>\n<p>So&hellip;. that is a SHITLOAD OF FUCKING transactions occurring!!!!!! So the present day amount of transactions right now occuring from Trinity, speculation, and trading, is like a pissing in the ocean compared to how many transactions the Qubic network will produce. Its not hard to understand, the Qubic network will run millions if not billions of transactions per day over the Tangle, and remember, &ldquo;each transaction confirms two transactions <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#128521;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<p>So&hellip;. what does that mean. More transactions means a faster Tangle, a more secure Tangle&hellip;. and most importantly&hellip;. WE CAN TAKE THE COO (Coordinator) OFFLINE!!!</p>\n<p>note: there may be use cases for multiple COO&rsquo;s (coordinators) or private COO&rsquo;s but that is a whole other arena and I simply state that from something I read from someone on&nbsp;Discord.</p>\n<p>The point is: Q is needed to remove the&nbsp;COO!</p>\n<p>So everyone saying, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t the dev&rsquo;s fucking working on removing the COO, &ldquo;wen remove COO&rdquo;, you can see that THEY ARE working on it!&rdquo;. The Qubic network will support the network because it incentives people to host nodes and earn&nbsp;IOTA!.</p>\n<p>Also, if no one uses the Qubic network then it doesn&rsquo;t work right?!? So making &ldquo;Corporate Partners&rdquo;, and United Nations (NGO) affiliates, is needed to support the Qubic&nbsp;Network.</p>\n<p>So here are the building blocks to the dev&rsquo;s&nbsp;vision:</p>\n<p>&ndash; You need a Tangle (Zero fee transactions that can that can send meta data)<br />\n&ndash; You need IOTA (A form of payment that can buy and sell resources (ie: PoW, PoS, PoBandwidth, and PoHonesty)<br />\n&ndash; You need the Qubic Network (creates Oracles, allows for Quorum Based Computations that powers Oracles.)<br />\n&ndash; You need Oracles (Oracles power smart-contracts which is the whole shabang! It will change society and change global finance).<br />\n&ndash; You need the Qubic Network (creates Oracles, this allows for Quorum Based Computations that powers Oracles.)et to enjoy because the IF includes us (with AMA&rsquo;s, takes time in discord, and offers transparency), and global partners such as Bosch, VW, Fujitsu, etc., We need governments and societies such as Taiwan, Denmark, and maybe Sweden; and we need banking like DnB, and electrical companies like Elaad (I think I stated ELaad incorrectly). We need the global integration to actually &ldquo;use&rdquo; the Qubic system for it to work (demand drives economic principals, which ultimately will pay the Q-Node providers)<br />\n&ndash; Lastly, you need to remove the COO and let the network grow organically. (This can only be done when all of the previous steps have been completed).</p>\n<p>Tangle -&gt;IOTA -&gt;Qubic Network -&gt;Oracles -&gt;Partners -&gt;&nbsp;COO</p>\n<p>So removing the COO is one of the last steps. After removing COO the network can just grow organically on it&rsquo;s own without much support or help from the dev&rsquo;s. They can then work on building applications that work on top of the Qubic&nbsp;network.</p>\n<p>This is a large challenging undertaking that is being built step-by-step, each piece is part of a large puzzle that all comes together. As for Qubic&rsquo;s, what was just released, it is a really large damn piece of that puzzle!!!</p>\n<p>It just goes to show, that all of this adds up to removing the COO. Everything the dev&rsquo;s, and the IF, have been doing are working towards simply that! It&rsquo;s all one big construct, not different pieces, everything ties together and the Qubic network is a large friggin piece of it all. Their sole mission is to complete the puzzle, the vision, so the COO can be removed, and the Tangle can literally change society through the machine&nbsp;economy.</p>\n<p>This is just my non-techie understanding at the moment. I have a lot more research and studying to do, but damn I love it! So glad to be apart of this&nbsp;journey</p>\n<p>Please clarify if I totally misunderstood anything, and looking forward to hear other peoples understanding.</p>\n<p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6387b18267d2" width="1" height="1" /></p>\n</p>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://medium.com/@jamesjdsutton/what-is-q-from-a-laymen-given-barney-style-6387b18267d2?source=rss-36f97abac343------2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">What is &ldquo;Q&rdquo; from a laymen given Barney style&hellip;</a> was originally published on <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesjdsutton?source=rss-36f97abac343------2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://medium.com/@jamesjdsutton?source=rss-36f97abac343&#8212;&#8212;2</a>.

The IOTA protocol was, in fact, created to help solve those problems. Indeed, IOTA was designed to become the global standard for IoT messaging and payments. Qubic follows that standard, and is made possible by fee-free IOTA transactions,&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Originally conceived in a September 2012 <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=112676.0">post</a> on BitcoinTalk, Qubic &mdash; or Quorum Based Coin &mdash; denotes the idea of a cryptocurrency offering all the utility of Bitcoin, with none of its disadvantages.</p>\n<p>While building on this concept, the IOTA team have quickly <a href="https://qubic.iota.org/">disclaimed</a> that IOTA&rsquo;s Qubic will not employ a new token or any form of airdrop.</p>\n<h2>Qubic: IOTA&rsquo;s Secret Weapon?<strong><br /></strong></h2>\n<p>While IOTA has <a href="https://www.iota.org/the-foundation/our-vision">positioned</a> itself primarily as &ldquo;Enabling the true Internet-of-Things,&rdquo; the reported functionality of Qubic would suggest loftier heights are in sight.</p>\n<p>In a manner remarkably close to Ethereum&rsquo;s mission statement, IOTA <a href="https://qubic.iota.org/intro">describes</a> how Qubic will ultimately &ldquo;secure the IOTA Tangle: an IOTA-based world supercomputer.&rdquo; When described in detail, it can be seen how deep the (Qubic) rabbit hole goes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Specifically, Qubic is a protocol that specifies IOTA&rsquo;s solution for quorum-based computations, including such constructs as oracle machines, outsourced computations, and smart contracts. Qubic provides general-purpose, cloud- or fog-based, permissionless, multiprocessing capabilities on the Tangle.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, Qubic&rsquo;s broad scope would transform IOTA into a regular dynamo &mdash; a jack of all trades up against a plethora of blockchain-based rivals: smart contract platforms, distributed computing networks, oracle networks, messaging platforms, peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies, and more.</p>\n<p>The IOTA Foundation&rsquo;s track record of execution and recent momentum would certainly lend IOTA enthusiasts enough reason to place their faith in Qubic.</p>\n</article>\n<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-white">\n<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>\n\t</div>\n<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/iota-unveils-qubic-the-key-to-an-iota-based-world-supercomputer/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IOTA Unveils Qubic: The Key to an &ldquo;IOTA-based World Supercomputer?&rdquo;</a> was originally published on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cryptoslate.com/</a>.

        content: '<p>In a new OmiseGo AMA session, Vitalik Buterin has once again staked his belief that second-layer solutions will enable Ethereum to handle more than one million transactions per second.</p>\n<p>During the AMA, Buterin noted that second-layer solutions such as Plasma and Sharing could be crucial in expanding Ethereum&#8217;s reach. While Plasma enables Ethereum to handle &#8216;micropayments&#8217; through child blockchains, Sharding divides a blockchain network to sections &#8211; or &#8216;shards&#8217; &#8211; which relieves nodes of having to process all new data items recorded on a blockchain.</p>\n<p><em>“The reason I think layer 1 and layer 2 [networks] are complementary is because ultimately, if you look at the math, the scalability gains from the layer 1 improvements and layer 2 improvements do ultimately multiply with each other&#8221;, </em>Buterin said.</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qD-IbiVpcT8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;If you have a Sharding solution, the Sharding solution itself might increase the scalability of Ethereum by a factor of 100, or eventually even more. But then, if you do Plasma on top of the scalability solution, then what that means is, you’re not just doing 100 times of the amount of activity but you are doing 100 times the amount of entrances, the amount of exits, and despite resolutions.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“So if you get a 100x from Sharding and a 100x from Plasma, those two basically give you a 10,000x scalability gain, which basically means blockchains will be powerful enough to handle most applications most people are trying to do with them”.</em></p>\n<p>Buterin has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSN5BaCzsbo">previously expressed his beliefs</a> when speaking with venture capital investor Naval Ravikant at TechCrunch&#8217;s Disrupt SF conference in 2017, while Buterin unveiled a new scaling solution in the form of<a href="https://www.coininsider.com/vitalik-buterin-unveils-plasma-cash-a-new-blockchain-scaling-solution/"> Plasma Cash</a> earlier this year.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.coininsider.com/coin/eth">Ether</a> is up by 1.26% day-on-day, and at press time trades at $607.54 USD.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coininsider.com/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-second-layer-one-million-transactions/">Buterin: Second-layer solutions could help Ethereum achieve one million transactions per second</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coininsider.com">Coin Insider</a>.</p>',
