            p The media side of CoinFi's platform offers crypto research, analysis, and market moving news, overlaid on top of real-time price charts.
            p While crypto research, analysis, and news already exists on the internet, there is still no single canonical source that surfaces all of the relevant market intelligence a crypto trader needs to stay on top of the markets, the same way a Bloomberg Terminal does for equities traders.
            p Fundamental value exists in digging below the surface. Not every investor has the time to scroll through Twitter, Reddit, forums, Slack/Telegram groups, Google, etc. in order to uncover hidden threads that may be relevant for trading. Diving deep often reveals valuable information to investors and traders, but is a time consuming activity.
            p Our technology systems aggregate this information and our in-house editorial team curates and filters the incoming news articles to ensure only the most important items are shown for optimum signal-to-noise ratio, saving you time and energy on research.
            p In addition, community analysts who uncover and publish useful information vetted by CoinFi’s crowdsourced fact-checking system and in-house moderation team are rewarded by the CoinFi ecosystem via tokens.

            p The technology side of CoinFi’s platform brings Wall Street caliber tools to the crypto market, and makes them available to the everyday crypto investor.
            p At the moment there are only a very limited range of signals and tools available in the crypto market. In fact, CoinFi’s very first trading signal was created when co-founder Timothy Tam started trading crypto on the side and realized he didn’t have access to any of the tools he used as hedge fund manager.
            p CoinFi's technology platform offers trading signals, trading algorithms, automated trading bots and data feeds. The platform includes in-house tools developed by ex-Wall Street technologists, as well as a marketplace that provides access to crowdsourced trading signals. Users who contribute their trading signals will receive CoinFi tokens commensurate to the community's assessment of their value.
            p Watch the videos to see some examples of trading signals that CoinFi has developed.
