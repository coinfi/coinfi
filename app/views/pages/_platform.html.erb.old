        <h4>Real-time News</h4>

        <p>Right now trying to find urgent trading news, alerts and abnormal price movements is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Information is distributed on multiple channels such as Slack, Telegram, Twitter, Reddit, etc.</p>

        There is no quick or easy way to answer daily recurring questions from traders such as:
        <ul>
          <li>What are the coins in the last 24 hours that have abnormal price and volume?</li>
          <li>What is the historical market moving news for this coin so I can get up to speed?</li>
          <li>Where are the high quality research thought pieces on this particular coin?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The CoinFi database will enable users to monitor and analyze real-time crypto market news information in ways that are currently impossible with existing tools. It changes the current delivery frequency of market news from delayed and spread out to aggregated and real-time, while helping to curate the best content with both community and machine learning support.</p>

        <h4>Trading Signals</h4>
        <p>
          Market inputs such as price, volume, social signals, and news, will be fed into both in-house and user contributed models that are overlaid with machine learning algorithms to output intelligent trading signals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Signals can include
          Which exchange has the best price

        </p>
        <p>
          These signals can generate real-time alerts via SMS, email, or push notifications to notify traders about market movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traders can use these signals to detect abnormal market movements, act to capitalize on the information, and capture this alpha with winning trades.

        <h4>Financial Analysis</h4>
        <p>In equities markets, research has shown that a crowd of experienced investors can often provide additional insight above and beyond Wall Street analysts and predict stock market returns better than traditional financial media outlets like the Wall Street Journal.</p>

        <p>CoinFi enables contributions from real investors instead of only depending on financial journalists who are not necessarily "in-the-trenches" or sell-side analysts who are restricted from trading the equities they cover so they have no skin in the game.</p>

        <p>In addition with the custom in-house model narrowing the focus on contributor authority, contributor history and social signals CoinFi is able to filter out and sort the highest quality research pieces so that traders who want to learn about the history of the coin.</p>

        <p>The platform also incentives coverage of small cap coins that are not cost effective for salaried journalists or analysts to cover but may present interest to segments of the community, especially since major profits are made when a cryptocurrency is in its early stages.</p>
