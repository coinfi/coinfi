      <div class="lh-copy">
      <strong>What happens to my tokens during and after the beta?</strong>
      <p>To reserve one of the 2,000 beta slots available, we're asking you to stake 20,000 COFI tokens for at least 3 months or until
      the beta ends, whichever comes first. Your tokens will be safely stored in our wallet.</p>
      <p>At the end of 3 months or the beta, you can choose to withdraw your tokens and cancel the service.</p>
      <strong>What am I getting in the beta?</strong>
      <p>You'll get first access to professional grade, data-backed trading signals designed to give you a trading edge.
      The signals will be released one-by-one as they complete thorough testing. In addition, we may release new signals that have not yet been mentioned.</p>
      <p>The signals will be delivered via Telegram in a private chat. We will expand to other notification methods in the future.</p>
