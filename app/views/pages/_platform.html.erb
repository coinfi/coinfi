            <h4>Hedge Fund Caliber Trading Signals</h4>
            <p>
              Market inputs such as price, volume, social signals, and news, will be fed into in-house and user contributed models that are overlaid with machine learning algorithms to output intelligent trading signals.
            </p>
            <p>
              These signals can generate real-time alerts via SMS, email, push notifications, or API webhooks to notify traders about changes in market conditions.
            </p>
            <p>Traders who use these signals to detect abnormal market movements can act quickly to capitalize on the information to capture alpha with winning trades.</p>

            <h4>Real Time Informational Advantage</h4>

            <p>Right now trying to find urgent trading news, alerts and abnormal price movements is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Information is distributed on multiple channels such as Slack, Telegram, Twitter, Reddit, etc.</p>

            There is no quick or easy way to answer daily recurring questions from traders such as:
            <ul>
              <li>What are the coins in the last 24 hours that have abnormal price and volume?</li>
              <li>What is the historical market moving news for this coin so I can get up to speed?</li>
              <li>Where are the high quality research thought pieces on this particular coin?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The CoinFi database will enable users to monitor and analyze real-time crypto market news in ways that are currently impossible with existing tools. Crowdsourcing and machine learning algorithms surface the highest quality and most relevant financial analysis.</p>

            <p>CoinFi internal modeling shows an <em>average savings of 0.5% per trade</em> - for traders that place an average of 1 trade per day, that adds up to an <strong>additional ROI of 182% a year</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Decentralizing Wall Street</h4>
            <p>Right now only the elites paying hundreds of thousands a year have access to Goldman Sach’s stock research reports and proprietary trading models and secret algorithms.  With Wall Street rapidly moving into the cryptocurrency space, it’s more imperative than ever that a decentralized platform exists which shares news, signals, financial models, trading signals and algorithms with the entire community.</p>

            <p>The CoinFi token economy is a sustainable ecosystem that incentives researchers, analysts, curators, and coders to contribute. It is designed to intelligently rewards users on the quality of their contributions.</p>

            <p>Scientific evidence consistently proves that a crowd of intelligent investors offer more insights and make better predictions. The CoinFi token empowers these crowds. <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GWQGFQ1P26HoqLxYpOlchw">Join us</a> and we can make better predictions than the Goldman Sachs analyst making $1 million USD a year.</p>
