      <h2>Wall Street Is Coming To The Crypto Markets</h2>

        <p>With Bitcoin returning 370% in 2017, an arms race is coming to crypto. Wall street has already formed over 70 crypto based hedge funds in the last six months.</p>

        <p>They bring with them lightning-fast sophisticated black box algorithmic trading signals, real-time analysis of news through powerful machine learning techniques, coupled with "best execution" trading algorithms.</p>

        <p>Main Street crypto traders will find it near impossible to compete if Wall Street succeeds in rapidly deploying their capabilities to our industry.</p>

        <p>CoinFi brings together a team of former Wall Street traders and technologists who want to transfer this knowledge and technology to a decentralized blockchain to share to the world, BEFORE Wall Street builds their centralized model.</p>

        <p>Bloomberg costs $24,000 USD for an annual subscription and is only available to the elites.</p>

        <p>CoinFi is a crowdsourced, decentralized platform built to share these capabilities with the masses and act as
        the canonical source of market intelligence for the next generation of successful crypto traders.</p>
