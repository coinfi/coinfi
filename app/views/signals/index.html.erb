                No. As professional traders, we don’t believe that anyone can accurately predict the exact best price to buy at or sell at. Anyone or any Telegram group that attempt to tell you that aren’t likely to be doing you any favors.

                Yes, we backtest our signals in bear markets and bull markets. In addition, our team of data scientists are constantly monitoring the effectiveness of these signals.

                Our team of professional traders start by asking themselves what trading signals they wish they have. Next, our team of data engineers gather the data such as getting a real time feed of all transactions that happen on the Ethereum blockchain. Finally, our team of data scientists backtest the signals for correlation with price movements. Only when we find a positive correlation with price movements do we release the signals to our members.
