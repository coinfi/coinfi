You're almost there!

To finish signing up, send exactly <%= number_with_delimiter(ENV.fetch('SIGNALS_STAKING_AMOUNT')) %> COFI tokens to <%= ENV.fetch('COINFI_COFI_STAKING_WALLET_ADDRESS') %>.

We expect your COFI tokens to come from this wallet address: <%= @staked_ethereum_address %>, which you provided previously.

If this address is not correct or if you want to change it, please resubmit your information at https://www.coinfi.com/signals/reservation

Important: Do NOT send tokens from an exchange since we cannot confirm the sender.

We'll send you a confirmation email when we receive your tokens.

If you have any questions, just reply to this email and we'll get back to you shortly.

See you on the other side,
The CoinFi Team
