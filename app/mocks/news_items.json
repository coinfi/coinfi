Not sure there are any other emerging asset classes that benefit a balanced portfolio this way.” And at the outset, Mr. Beck’s attempt is to first square digital assets with Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). In short, he believes “many of today’s asset allocators are missing out on a ‘free lunch.’ That’s because (i) digital assets represent a brand new investment opportunity that is uncorrelated to other asset classes and (ii) investors are generally under-allocated to this sector. It is our view that the optimal beta portfolio lies somewhere higher than what was previously believed to be the efficient frontier, and digital assets are the proverbial ‘missing piece of the puzzle.’”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBreathlessly, Mr. Beck insists “digital assets are squarely at the intersection of some of the most significant trends reshaping the global economy, including: A new market paradigm, characterized by slow economic growth, low interest rates, and divergent central bank policies. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eRapid advancements in financial technologies and payment infrastructure, which now make it possible to move, settle, and clear value/assets at the same speed as information in a digital format.

This provides evidence that digital assets can be considered a diversifying component in multi-asset portfolios. Moreover, many digital assets are imperfectly correlated to one another, which means there may even be diversification benefits within the asset class itself.” A healthy chunk of the paper runs through hypothetical investment scenarios, and while they’re \u0026#8216;mathy\u0026#8217; and graph-laden, they’re somewhat less convincing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eA general good rule of thumb when thinking about cryptocurrencies is how no one, not one person, understands them. Sure, they’ve got parts of the equation, and that can be very powerful, but ultimately digital assets still face giant hurdles with regard to mainstream adoption, the kind Grayscale hopes. Regulation, which they’re on record as inviting, could strangle the golden goose, as was empirically the case with New York’s Bit License. Add to the above whether institutional money will finally find its way into the space with the liquidity long dreamed by the likes of GI, and conservative mom and pop investors probably won’t be so keen on incorporating crypto long term. Mr. Beck concludes, acknowledging it is “still early in the lifecycle of digital assets, but we believe our multifaceted approach to assess their investability makes a compelling case for investors to have some portion of their portfolio allocated to this new asset class. A lot can happen over the next few years, but remember: diversification is a ‘free lunch’ and asset allocation is all about the long-game.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you think crypto enhances return and reduces risk?
